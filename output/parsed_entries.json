This is the end of the trip to Seattle for the opening at the\nSeattle Art Museum there, then we’d gone to Los Angeles for Marisa\nBerenson’s wedding to Jim Randall, then to Vancouver for my Ace Gallery\nshow opening there. Nobody in Vancouver buys art, though—they’re not\ninterested in painting. Catherine Guinness [see Introduction] didn’t get\nedgy till the last day when she started this annoying thing the English do—\nasking me over and over, “What exactly is Pop Art?” It was like the time we\ninterviewed that blues guy Albert King for Interview, when she kept asking,\n“What exactly is soul food?” So for two hours on the plane she tortured me\n(cab from La Guardia $13, tip $7—Catherine was grand and gave him the\nwhole $20). Dropped Fred off. Got home. Ate an early Thanksgiving dinner\nwith Jed [see Introduction]. He’d gotten the car serviced for the drive down\nto Chadds Ford in the morning to Phyllis and Jamie Wyeth’s."

      "text": "Fred called at 8 A.M. to find out when we were leaving. Barbara Allen\ncalled and said that if we were leaving after 12:00 she would come (film\n$19.98). Cabbed to 860 [860 Broadway, at 17th Street, at the northeast\ncorner of Union Square Park, where Andy rented the entire third floor for\nboth his offices and the offices of Interview magazine] to pick up some\nthings to take. Left around 1:00 (cab $3.60, gas $19.97, tolls $3.40).\nBeautiful day.\nJed somehow drove straight to the Wyeths’ door, with just one phone\ncall for directions (phone $.10) at a turnoff right near the place to get the\nlast bit. Arrived around 4:00. The traffic was okay. Barbara Walters didn’t\ncome after all.\nAndrew Wyeth, Jamie’s father, was there. Frolic Weymouth was there, a\nneighbor—his wife who’s Andrew Wyeth’s niece had just left him for an\nantique dealer or something after lots of married years—he’s a du Pont—\nand he was depressed, so he was over for dinner. And Andrew’s two sisters,\none nutty who looks like she drinks and paints.\nWe sat for hours and hours at dinner, it was perfect, so good. Lots of\ndrinks. I was still so tired from all the traveling at the beginning of the\nweek. Jed went to bed around 2:00, everyone else stayed up until around\n4:00.\nThere was a romantic interest going on. Robin West—he’s a neighbor of\nthe Wyeths, too, he works for the Pentagon but he’ll be losing his job soon\nbecause Carter’s coming in—he was there, and Catherine talked about shit\nand piss for him and about the Anvil S&M bar, and he seemed to like that\nand got interested. He’s looking for a rich girl to marry, he asked me where\noh where was his tub of butter on the other side of the rainbow, and I told\nhim it could be a tub of Guinness beer if he played his cards right. He said\nhe’d take us for a ride in an aircraft carrier before his job gets given to a\nDemocrat."

Then\nPhyllis Wyeth got the buggy together, we had an all-American breakfast,\nfed Archie and Amos [see Introduction], then we went out for a ride. We\nwent across the Brandywine River in it, it wasn’t so deep.\nJed went to meet Vincent [see introduction] and Shelly and Ronnie [see\nIntroduction] and Gigi at the train station. Went with Jamie to the\nBrandywine Museum and we were photographed and had a press\nconference. Went back to Jamie and Phyllis’s and there were cocktails. Mrs.\nBartow who I bought the East 66th Street house from was there and she\nasked when I was going to sandblast it and why was I never home because\nit always looked dark. Carter Brown was there and Jane Holzer with Bob\nDenison.\nRode to the museum. I introduced Gigi as “George”—I’d told this guy\nshe was a drag queen and he didn’t know I was kidding, he got excited—\nand then she said, “No, it’s Georgette,” which coincidentally is her real\nname—I didn’t know it. So everything was coming out right—I mean it\nwas just what a drag queen would say, so that was funny. And the guy really\nliked her and she didn’t have a clue it was because he thought she was a\nboy."

It was like an old-fashioned Christmas.\nThen went over to the museum where an antique dealer was having a\nbenefit for an opera school, and I really enjoyed that, they were singing an\nopera.

      "text": "Catherine called New York, to Jodie Foster’s place, to confirm the interview\nshe and I were supposed to do that afternoon, and Jodie’s mother hedged\nsaying Jodie was sick and maybe she couldn’t do it, but to call when we got\nback to town. Got back at 12:30 (gas $16.50, tolls $3.40). Dropped\nCatherine and Fred. Catherine called Jodie again and she said okay.\nIt was a beautiful day, in the sixties again. Picked up Catherine and\nwalked over to the Pierre Hotel to meet Jodie. Said hello to lots of people\nwho said hello to me. At the Pierre I saw a beautiful woman staring at me\nand it turned out to be Ingrid Bergman. While I was talking to her, Coco\nBrown started waving and yelling from a car. Ingrid’s I think husband came\nfor her and then Catherine and I went into the restaurant to wait for Jodie.\nShe came in with her mother and a guy they said they’d picked up I think in\nLiverpool, and I couldn’t tell if it was a bodyguard or the mother’s\nboyfriend. Jodie had on high boots and a hat and was really cute and we\nloved her ($30 with tip).\nThen we all walked over to F.A.O. Schwarz and looked at toys. Bought\nsome for Jodie ($10). She signed autographs. On the way back to the Pierre\na guy was selling big candy canes and he gave Jodie one and me one.\nWent home. Nelson Lyon called from L.A. and told me about his\nThanksgiving—Paul Morrissey had invited him to dinner at Chase Mellen’s\nhouse and then called back to disinvite him saying it was going to be “small\nand intimate” and that he’d made a mistake inviting anyone. As soon as\nNelson hears that anything is “small and intimate” he gets paranoid he’s not\ninvited and goes crazy to get there, so he put his mind to it and got there\nthrough someone else. It turned out to be thousands of people there so when\nhe saw Paul he said, “Small, intimate world, isn’t it?”\nBrigid Polk [see Introduction] called and said she’s down to 197. Ever\nsince she saw herself in Bad [see Introduction] weighing 300 pounds and\nwent on a diet, she’s so boring to talk to—she never does anything, she\nnever thinks anything, she just lies there in bed in her room at the George\nWashington Hotel and waits for the fat to roll off. I told her I’ll give her a\njob—that she could let some roll off around the Factory while she answers\nphones, but she won’t. It’s taken her thirty-nine years to lose weight and\nit’ll probably take her another thirty-nine years to get to work.\nI was too tired to meet the Vreeland crowd for dinner. Watched twenty-\nfive years of Lucille Ball on TV instead.\nVictor Hugo, Halston’s “art adviser,” called me from San Francisco\nbecause I’d told him I loved the display window he did of turkey bones at\nHalston’s Madison Avenue store, and now someone broke in and took the\nturkey bones, so he thought it was (laughs) me."

Cabbed to Union Square ($4). Amos\nwas down at the office and Ricky Clifton took pictures of him in costume as\nthe pope.\nLeft to go down to the Ileana Sonnabend Gallery to the David Hockney\nopening. He wasn’t showing new stuff, just portfolios. Took Amos (cab\n$2.50). Ran into Gerard Malanga [see Introduction]. Gerard wrote to Fred\nasking why he wouldn’t let him do photography for Interview, I guess he\njust wants a press pass. Fred won’t have anything to do with Gerard because\nwe’re still getting repercussions from all the fake Electric Chairs we think\nhe did, they’re being resold and resold and each time the money involved\ngets bigger, so Fred isn’t about to give Gerard anything. The opening was\njammed. Didn’t see David Hockney, he must’ve been in another room.\nChanged and went over to dinner at the Iranian embassy. Not really the\n“embassy,” but you know what I mean—it’s where Mr. Hoveyda, their\nambassador to the U.N., lives (cab $3). China Machado was there and she\nsaid she’s known Ambassador Hoveyda for ten years or more from when he\nand her husband were in France hanging around the French filmmakers in\nthe sixties. We talked about how horrible Avedon is, she said he gets what\nhe wants out of a person and then drops them. I agreed and then everybody\nscreamed at me that I do the same thing.\nPat Kennedy Lawford was there and a du Pont lady who lives next door\nto the embassy who said it was so nice not to have to go far for a meal and\nso she was late. She was wearing a black and gold dress with a jewel collar\nthat she said always gets impounded at customs. The food was good, but the\ncaviar only came around once."

Helen goes\naround with John Radziwill now. Fred thinks she’s great and that we should\nbe nice to her.

Peggy and Arlene are Kitty’s sidekicks\nfrom “To Tell the Truth.” The dinner was to honor Kitty for being named\nthe new head of the New York State Council on the Arts by Governor\nCarey.\nMy doctor, Doc Cox, was there and he took me upstairs for a tour of\nEdwin Booth’s bedroom and it was musty and dusty, same as in the old\ndays.\nDinner was served and it was everything creamy I’m not supposed to eat\nbecause of my gallbladder, so the Doc was embarrassed that he was seeing\nme eat it because it was putting a damper on a social occasion, so he told\nme, “I won’t look.” Met Alfred Drake who was on Broadway, that big\nhandsome star of Carousel.\nEveryone made speeches and then Kitty got up and she was the best.\nShe was wearing black and pearls, looked very chic. She says she still\nwants to work a lot and I remember that Diana Vreeland once told me that\nKitty had to “work like a nigger” because she doesn’t have that much\nmoney. The Doc dropped me off."

Dropped\noff Catherine ($4). Walked over to Halston’s. Victor had said there was\nroom for me at Halston’s table at the Metropolitan opening we were all\ngoing to, of Diana Vreeland’s Russia show. When we got to Halston’s Mrs.\nHenry J. Kaiser—Aly—was there, she was in a blue-green Halston with\nemeralds, and she seemed very interested in me, and when Halston saw us\ngetting along he suggested I take her upstairs to show her the portraits I did\nof him. After the trip upstairs, though, she dropped me, I guess she saw me\nin the light.\nWe were all waiting for Marisa and her new husband and Bianca and her\ndate, Joe Eula. The acupuncture doctor they all use was there, Dr. Giller, so\nhe’s on their party list now. Barbara Allen was there, the only one of the\nladies not wearing a Halston. She had on a beautiful off-the-shoulder\nChristian Dior. It was from her shopping spree in Paris last month when\nPhilip Niarchos was buying.\nMarisa came and she had her hair piled all on one side of her head like a\nbeautiful old-time star. Bianca had her purple fox with her, the one she’s\nhad around the past month. When Joe walked in he and Halston “shook\nhands” and when Halston felt what Joe put in his palm he said, “Oh, you’ve\nsaved my life.”\nVictor took me into the garage to show me his latest artwork—he’s\n(laughs) making Mona Lisas wearing Halstons, and that’s really funny, so I\nencouraged him. Then we went to the Met in four limos. This was the\nbiggest one of these things the museum has ever had. When Diana walked\nthrough we all kissed her. I talked to Mrs. Kaiser and got to know her. She’s\nabout sixty but she looks forty, and she says she’s looking for a fuck. I told\nher it’s the wrong town, everyone’s gay, and she said she didn’t care—“they\ntumble well. I’ve had some good luck here.” She lives at U.N. Plaza. It\nturns out she’s a very good friend of Brigid’s mother, Honey Berlin. She\nsaid that when she was at their house old Dick Berlin was so senile he\nwalked in and rushed over to the mirror and tried to shake hands with\nhimself but she saw what he was doing and went over and was the hand for\nhim to shake. I left right after dinner, Mrs. Kaiser dropped me.\nOh, and also at the dinner table Bianca took off her panties and passed\nthem over to me and I faked smelling them and then tucked them in my\nhandkerchief pocket. I still have them."

      "text": "Met Bob Colacello [see Introduction] and Fran Lebowitz, and we went\ndown in the rain to the Biltmore Hotel to the Overseas Press Corps lunch.\nBob had told them weeks ago when they invited me that I would come and\njust be present but that he would give the talk on Interview and they said\nfine. After Bob’s speech, though, they asked questions all directed at me—\nand I wasn’t prepared so I just said yes or no. But afterwards I regretted\ndoing my same old shy act, when I should have used the situation for\npractice—I’d love to be able to talk more and give little speeches. I want to\nwork on that.\nThey asked Fran only one question, why her column in Interview was\ncalled “I Cover the Waterfront,” and she said that it was because Tennessee\nWilliams was on a talk show once and they asked him if he was a homo and\nhe said, “Well, let’s put it this way: I cover the waterfront.” And Fran’s\nanswer was a lead balloon, nobody laughed. In the cab downtown she said\nshe’d rather have her appendix out than go to something like that again.\nBianca called and invited me to a screening of Silver Streak. Didn’t get\nhome until 7:00 which was exactly when I was supposed to be at the Pierre\nto pick her up—she and Mick just rented a house on 72nd Street but it’s not\nready to move into yet. Went over to the Loews Tower East. The movie was\nkind of funny. Bianca looked beautiful. Afterwards outside the theater when\nwe couldn’t find the limo a black guy with a black scarf was pressing\nhimself up against Bianca and he was crazy, he was saying, “You think\nyou’re the only one with beautiful clothes in the world?”\nFinally we found the car and went to La Grenouille. Isabel and Freddy\nEberstadt and Mica Ertegun arrived and with them was Isabel and Freddy’s\nbeautiful daughter, Nenna. I kept staring at her and saying how beautiful\nshe was, and Isabel sort of kept us apart. I couldn’t figure out why they had\nasked me to this dinner because if I hadn’t asked to bring Bianca, there\nwould have been just me. Mica was very sweet. She kept saying that Joe\nAllen was so attractive, that how could Barbara Allen leave him.\nThe Eberstadt daughter didn’t say anything during dinner but then she\nfinally blurted out that she used to go to Union Square and stare up at the\nFactory, so that was thrilling to hear from this beautiful girl. I told her she\nshould come down and do interviews for Interview and she said, “Good! I\nneed the money.” Isn’t that a great line? I mean, here Freddy’s father died\nand left him a whole stock brokerage company.\nWe said our good nights and thank-yous and I hope I remember to send\nflowers."

I reminded her\nthat I saw her in Bloomingdale’s the other week when we both were in the\nshirt department, and she said, “Oh yes, those shirts were Christmas\npresents for my family.” So it was just regular old shirts for her family, but\nfor Jamie it was an American quilt.\nShe was the first to leave, and then we we relived the faux pas that\nLincoln had made in front of her; he forgot she was a sister and when they\nwere talking politics he said that John Kennedy was “corrupt,” and she just\nsaid, “No, he wasn’t.”\nAfter lunch we went down to Lincoln’s house on East 19th Street and he\nshowed us his art, it was good paintings—Lincoln’s brother-in-law Paul\nCadmus, George Tooker, and Jared French, all Realists who’d done\npaintings of muscle boys. He didn’t have anything of mine.\nWalked over to Union Square. Worked the rest of the afternoon."

He’s the tin king of Bolivia.\nI overheard Kitty describing me to somebody and I guess somebody\nmust have talked to her about me because what she was saying was\nsounding like somebody had told it to her—“He’s one of the furthest off-\nBroadway, and a far (laughs) head of his time,” and things like that. Maybe\nit was Billy Baldwin or somebody like that she got that stuff from.\nI missed Kitty’s regular butler, the one that had the fight with Diana\nVreeland’s maid. He was fired for being too familiar, but I really liked him\n—he’s the one who told me to watch those A.E. Coppard stories on channel\n13.\nAnd after dinner, I sat underneath Goya’s “Red Boy.” Kitty has this most\nfamous painting right there in her house, it’s unbelievable.\nKitty’s parties used to be the biggest thing in New York with every\nHollywood star there and now it was down to just her friends. Aileen Mehle\n—“Suzy”—didn’t even RSVP this year.\nDiane de Beauvau took my hand and we ran into the next room right as\nmidnight was coming on. I sort of wanted to stay and kiss the old bags like I\ndid the year before because actually it was so much fun to do—to kiss\nninety-year-old Elsie Woodward and say, “Happy New Year, darling.” Then\nMinnie de Beauvau came in and got Diane and told her she had to go back\nin and say Happy New Year to their father and stepmother—because she\nknows where their bread’s buttered.\nAnd the food at Kitty’s—it was the canned frozen stuff again. At first\nyou think that maybe these rich people don’t know any better because\nthey’ve been going to charity dinners all their lives, but then they do go to\nLa Grenouille, too, and that’s really good food. So they must notice the\ndifference. And there were six servants serving the canned food.\nRight after midnight it was everybody grabbing their coats, they\ncouldn’t wait to go on to the next party. Fred was really drunk. We got out\non the street and he thought he was the “It Boy”—he gave Minnie his coat\n—the wind-chill factor was making it around twenty below—and he was\njust in his top hat, kissing everyone on the street. We walked Diane to the\nWestbury to pick up her boyfriend who’d stayed home to write a script, but\nwhen we got there he was in the nude waiting to fuck her, so we left her\nthere.\nWent home. Called Brigid. Called PH [see Introduction]. Nobody was\nhome yet. At 6 A.M. Jay Johnson woke me up calling to speak to Jed. He\nwas drunk and I hung up on him and he called back and let it ring twenty\ntimes."

A big spread on\ntable, nothing compared to Iran’s big spreads. The men looked fat, but\nusually in costume you couldn’t tell too much. But this one was chubby. He\nhad bought the Marilyn and the Flower prints. He was wearing a girl’s\ndiamond-studded watch with a blue face. The Kuwaiti food was greasy—\ngreasy roast.\nBought crab soap ($6). At 8:00 we were picked up by Mr. Bater, who\nwas the cultural attaché from the United States to Kuwait, and taken to see\nthe American Ambassador Morandi who was giving us a dinner. His wife\nwas from Seattle, talked so much it drove us crazy. They were Democrats.\nDinner was served at 10:00. Left at 12:00, bored. Used the crab soap, it\ndidn’t work. Fell asleep in the bathtub. In bed couldn’t sleep. Read the Ruth\nKligman book again, she was driving Jackson Pollock crazy in the car and\nthat’s when he ran into the pole. Gave it to Fred to read."

They sit on the floor and paint\non rugs and pillows, it looked like hippie streetwares, like the sixties. It was\nthe only nicely designed building in Kuwait because it was a copy of the\nFord Foundation. Got a tour of the building.

I think his name was\nAhmad Al-Adwani—have that name written down. But maybe that name\ngoes with someone else.

Suzie invited us along to have a drink in Bel Air at her model\nfriend Cheryl Tiegs’s and her husband Stan Dragoti, who works for Wells\nRich Greene. Fred was bitten by a big dog when he opened the wrong door\nwhen he was looking for the bathroom, but he didn’t say anything about it\nuntil there was lots of blood coming down his leg. He just put some alcohol\non and then we left at 7:30.\nIn the lobby ran into Annie Leibovitz and Jann Wenner. Susan Blond left\na message saying she was with Michael Jackson at Top of the Rox. Jann\nand Annie had just gotten back from there, the Grammys had just finished\nup, so everyone was drunk. A couple of boys in the lobby tried to pick me\nup."

The first car left, we were in the second, and we\nhad a house number 36912 in Malibu. When we got there we couldn’t find\nit, but then the first car came along with Richard Weisman in it and he went\nto knock at 36910 because there was no 12, and the person who opened the\ndoor was “Mary Hartman,” with her funny braids on.\nShe said she’d have a party for us if we couldn’t find the party we were\ngoing to. But just then Coco Brown came by in another car with Wendy\nStark and they said it was just down the block, that Wendy’d got the number\nwrong.\nWe got to the house and Bianca was there. She’d had a fight with Mick\nand he’d left that morning for New York—she’d accused him of an affair\nwith Linda Ronstadt.\nWalked down the beach with Bianca past the house of Larry Hagman,\nand he was standing on the beach in a funny uniform like a foreign-legion\noutfit, doing funny hand things, and I guess he’s gone off his rocker. While\nwe were going by the sea came up and wet my shoes.\nSpent three hours trying to make dinner plans. Bob Ellis, Diana Ross’s\nex, and Alana Hamilton seemed too drunk, Bianca didn’t want to be with\nMiranda because she was the sister of Sabrina, Jed said he was hungry and\nhe’d eat anywhere, and Wendy wanted us to go to Max Palevsky’s because\nshe thought it would be good for us—he was going to have us over to see\nhis art collection.\nAnd so finally when we got together we went to a restaurant called\nOrsini’s, Italian food.

He\ndropped us off at the Mark Hopkins, had lunch at the Top of the Mark.\nThen we walked to the gallery three blocks away down a steep, steep\nhill. The space was very large, and it was just around where we used to stay\nwith the Velvets [see Introduction]. The hanging was just wild. Rotten,\nbadly hung. Unbelievable. Bad taste. Mark’s mother just horrible.\nPress conference, TV show with a guy who was a beauty but he didn’t\nknow anything and didn’t really like me and so I was being awful, too.

Brought the limo back, went to the strip joint, Carol is now just as\nwide as high, saw three naked girls rubbing their asses and cunts against the\nfloor, and Carol Doda came down on the piano and went up to the ceiling\non it.

And then more and\nmore people started coming in and saying, “Is it really you?” I got out.\nThe waiters said that there were only waitresses some nights, the place\nalternated.

Arnold Weissberger and Milton\nGoldman have the longest-running gay marriage in New York. Arnold is\nseventy-something, the biggest old-time show-biz lawyer and amateur\nphotographer. He takes pictures of everyone who comes to his house. He\nhad a book out last year called Famous Faces. He had the book on the\ndining table at the party and he was making the famous faces sign it next to\ntheir pictures. Milton Goldman is sixty-something and a big agent at IFA.\nBob noticed that he was the only person under thirty there—barely—and I\nsaid that Arnold must be afraid to have young kids because he might lose\nMilton. All the butlers and bartenders were over sixty. They brought one\ndrink at a time and the tray shaked.\nPaulette Goddard was there, she told me that she didn’t sell one rug at\nParke Bernet because the dealers, she felt, had ganged up on her.

On the way in the\nfriend of Lester Persky’s who always feels me up grabbed me and\nintroduced me to Neile McQueen, and she was actually pretty. He\nwhispered, “Ex-wife, Steve McQueen” in my ear.\nArnold walked in with three little girls, one of them was a sportswriter\non The New York Times, and she’s in love with him.\nThen the most fascinating thing happened. A guy who Elaine introduced\nme to did his card tricks, and it was where he flashed the deck and then said\nthink of a card and then he guessed the card eight times! I couldn’t get it out\nof my mind, I thought about it all night. I’ve just got to know how he did it,\nbecause if you can do that, you can do anything.

Bob\nmade me go in black tie, but we were the only formal ones and then his\nexcuse was that we were invited to so many parties he didn’t remember.\nWe’re starting to feel used by the Iranians.

It was jumping—\nArman and Corice, Larry Rivers—great party.\nGigi was there and she just broke up with Ronnie and went off with\nSpyro Niarchos, and so Ronnie was depressed.

That’s\nthe gist of it. Gigi had told me she was going to. Barbara Allen was there\nwith Philip Niarchos, they’re back in town.\nDennis Hopper was supposed to be there, but I missed him. He’s living\nwith/staying with Caterine Milinaire—they’re (laughs) “together.” Ronnie’s\nfriend Tony Shafrazi was there, just back from Iran. He’s the one who\ndefaced Picasso’s painting at the Modern. The “Guernica.”\nHoveyda told us that Sidney Lumet is coming to Paulette’s dinner at the\nembassy next week and we said, “That’s nice.” I hear that Sidney Lumet\ngoes around town calling me a racist just because Mandingo was my\nfavorite movie of the year."

Ted Carey was having health\nproblems and he went to Dr. Cox, and Doc Cox was a good doctor because\nhe recognized the symptoms Ted had and said it was syphilis of the throat.\nThe Doc must have other patients with that problem, probably.

Spyro told Bob that now he\nthought Gigi was awful to involve him in her mess with Ronnie. So she\nblew it.\nAnyway at lunch everyone was sitting down and Ronnie came in and\nstarted filling his plate and then he said, “Where’s my seat?” And I got\nscared there’d be trouble because he was acting kind of hysterical, so I told\nhim that somebody had to answer the phones and anyway, that if he sat\ndown there’d be thirteen at the table. Worked until about 4:00. Barbara\nlooked very very thin, she said that Peter Marino was doing a wonderful job\ndesigning her apartment. Cabbed up to pick up Victor to take him to Suzie\nFrankfurt’s open house—“Suzie Frankfurt at Home” (cab $5). Fred was\nthere and so was Francesca Stanfill from Women’s Wear Daily.

Dropped Suzie’s ex-husband Steve Frankfurt off ($3). Went to the\nEast Side antiques show ($2.50). Walked home.\nBob and I picked up Elsa Martinelli at the St. Regis to take her to the\nIranian embassy. It was a buffet, jammed. In honor of the new American\nambassador to Italy, Mr. Gardner, and his wife Danielle.\nI got stuck talking to the Baroness de Bodisco. Hoveyda tried to rescue\nme and said to her, “I think there’s someone upstairs it would be nice if you\ncame with me to meet,” and she said, “No.” And then Hoveyda said she\nwouldn’t be invited back again, and she said, “I don’t care.”\nFriday, March 11,1977\nI had a talk with Rick Li Brizzi at the office, told him he was selling my\nMaos and Soup Cans too cheap. Went home to change, picked up by\nCatherine, went to Nima Isham’s for a birthday party for Firooz and her\nhusband Chris Isham ($3).\nThe apartment was decorated with streamers and balloons.

With a thirteen-year-old girl he took to a\nparty at Jack Nicholson’s house, and when the police went over to Jack’s\nthe next day after the girl’s parents called them, they searched the house and\nAnjelica got arrested for coke.\nVictor had told me that I absolutely had to watch the Dinner with\nHalston show on channel 5 —Metromedia.\nThis is the idea that we submitted to Larry Freeberg at Metromedia and\nthey turned down, and now they’re doing with other people. Halston’s\nguests were Bianca, Joe Eula, the acupuncture doctor—Giller, Jane Holzer,\nVictor. It was very boring. They’d asked me to go on this show and I said\nno because they’d ripped off my idea.\nIt was a live dinner with a seven-second delay. Joe Eula said “bullshit”\nonce and it was cut. The only real-life thing missing at the table was coke,\nand no runs to the bathroom. Victor was the life of the dinner, he took his\nfake mustache off. He used to have a real one but he’d shaved it off\nprobably because he hates the acupuncture doctor who has one, but he put\none on for the show. He also had a plastic chicken with him and kept\ntalking to it, telling it to “say hello to Andy.” Joe Eula and Victor had a tiff\nat the table, something about me. Joe told Victor, “Let Andy speak for\nhimself, why he’s not here,” and that’s when Victor—on Metromedia—said\nthat Metromedia had ripped me off. So he was great.\nJane didn’t have the right makeup on so she didn’t look good, and they\nkept referring to her as “the renowned fashion model.” The dinner\ndegenerated into throwing drinks. Maybe they’d decided on that because\nthey’re supposed to be the “wild set.” Jane threw champagne in the air and\nthen everybody started but it looked so lame, and so Victor poured his in\nher lap. Victor and Halston were having a quarrel—you could tell because\nVictor announced that he wasn’t going to do Halston’s windows anymore,\nthat he was now “an artist for hire,” and the camera went close on Halston’s\nhard face. At one point Halston or Bianca or somebody actually said, “Let’s\ntake this hour and a half and just go with it!” And that’s when most people\nprobably shut their TVs off, the thought of something like that dragging on\nfor an hour and a half must’ve made them gag.\nAnd meanwhile who should Fred be at dinner with but Larry Freeberg,\nwho’d stolen the idea from me in the first place. They were all at the\nHermitage, at a dinner for Nureyev, and Freeberg was with Lee Radziwill—\nthey’re planning to do a channel 5 dinner with her, too.\nHalston was having a “cast party” at his place after the show. When I got\nthere, Mick had come by. He was cute—he told Bianca how good she was\non the show, but around 4:00 he wanted to leave and she didn’t so she\nstayed. Everyone was mad at Victor, saying he’d ruined the show, so he’d\nalready left to go barring."

I said I made my big mistake saying, “What\nwas your sex life like with Chaplin?”\nWednesday, March 16,1977\nHad to leave the office early to go home and change because I had to be at\nAly Kaiser’s place at U.N. Plaza. She’s about sixty years old, but looks\nyounger. She was the nurse and he was Kaiser Aluminum and he married\nher. She had a limo, and the big French poodle sat up front with the\nchauffeur’s cap on. We went over to Bergdorf Goodman’s. Halston was\ngiving a fashion show/ benefit for Martha Graham. It was everybody that\nyou always see at Martha Graham benefits. I didn’t have to buy the $100\nticket, Aly did. Met Andrew and Mrs. Goodman, the owners of Bergdorf’s,\nand they live upstairs over the store. She’s Cuban. Saw Pat Cleveland with\nEsther Phillips. Mrs. Kaiser fell in love with Esther.\nThen we all went over to Regine’s. Mrs. Kaiser, Esther, and her\nhairdresser boyfriend. Fred came in with Suzie Frankfurt in a Grès. C.Z.\nGuest was there with Prince Rupert Loewenstein. Everybody was\nimpressed with Esther. For the first time, I danced. It was the first time in\npublic. Esther took me on the floor and taught me how to disco, she thought\nit was funny and I did, too.\nThen the kids wanted to smoke and Aly brought them back to her\napartment which was being painted so it was a little messy. She brought out\na bag of marijuana. They started smoking. I really like Esther."

Lester Persky\ncalled and invited me to dinner at his place for Baryshnikov but I was going\nto be with Nureyev at the Iranian embassy for his birthday party. Cabbed\nwith Vincent down to Frank Stella’s studio ($2.75), a party for Leo\nCastelli’s twenty years in the art business. Fred said I’d have to go—just the\nkind of party I hate because they’re all like me, so similar, and so peculiar,\nbut they’re being so artistic and I’m being so commercial that I feel funny. I\nguess if I thought I were really good I wouldn’t feel funny seeing them all.\nAll the artists I’ve known for years are with their second wives or\ngirlfriends—Claes Oldenburg had a new girlfriend, so did Rosenquist. Roy\nwas with Dorothy, Ed Ruscha was with Diane Keaton, Leo had his ex-wife\nIleana Sonnabend there and his wife Toiny and Barbara Jakobson—all the\ngirls fall in love with him for some reason. David Whitney was cute,\nhelping. I borrowed film from one of Leo’s secretaries.\nThe artists did a “you sign mine and I’ll sign yours” thing and I got a\ncouple of signatures— Claes, and then Keith Sonnier, who I like. Nancy the\ncheckpayer from Leo’s was there. The place is on Jones Street, and it\nreminded me of when I used to live there and my roommate, Lila Davies,\npicked up a Chinese guy and brought him home thinking he was nice and\nhe pulled out a knife.\nWent home, slept a little, then crawled out of bed to go pick up Andrea\nPortago to go to the Iranian embassy. Andrea looked lovely, she’s back to\nwanting to be a movie star, her mind lapses for a while and then she picks it\nup again. Paulette was there, she sold the rights to the novel Remarque\nwrote about Andrea’s father, Heaven Has No Favorites—an awful title,\nPaulette said. She got $100,000 plus 10 percent of the movie from\nParamount. It’s called Bobby Deerfield now and stars Al Pacino as Andrea’s\nfather, Fon de Portago, the race-car driver.\nAfter dinner Andrea wanted to be taken to Baryshnikov’s party at Lester\nPersky’s but as we were leaving, Bianca and François Catroux came in and\nsaid they’d just been there and not to go that it was awful, so we went back\nto Nureyev’s party and then had to go through the “you’re backs” for a\nwhile. But then Andrea decided Bianca was only telling us that Lester’s was\nbad to stunt her career, that it was probably a great party and that Milos\nForman would be there so it would be good for her, so we went after all.\nCab to the Hampshire House ($3). Lester is high up, and as we sat there\ntalking the chandelier kept moving, a big one. I was nervous about it.\nBaryshnikov was so sweet. Milos was cute, telling me we had the same\nkind of shoes. Brooke Hayward was there and threw her arms around me\nand said, “I’m so successful, I don’t know what to do.” I think she’s nutty.\nLester had works by Rosenquist and Rauschenberg, but just one Cow I\ngave him and a Marilyn. He should have bought my stuff early on. I’m\ntrying to get some Dollars on his wall, though. Lester’s is cozy. Dropped off\nAndrea (cab $3)."

We talked for twenty minutes about what\nhappened to her ass, it just isn’t there anymore. I told her she should never\nsee Bad because if she did and saw herself that fat and with the farting\nsounds, she’d be furious at us.\nWent to Mortimer’s for a party for Edie Vonnegut’s picture-drawing that\nshe did of “Mortimer.” Is there really a Mortimer? And I couldn’t believe\nthe drawings would be that bad. Kurt Vonnegut was there, gave a little\nspeech about how talented his daughter was.

Fred and I\nhad to go to a meeting at Roger Corman’s office, so cabbed there ($5). It\nwas a brand-new building, met all the young kids who work for him. Fred\nsaid Roger was “very shy and never gives interviews” but he’s not shy, I\nnoticed, and he’s been giving a lot of them lately.\nDiana Vreeland had a limo and we were going out to George Cukor’s\nwith her. George wouldn’t let me take photos. I was disappointed. He said\nhe loved Bad, raved about it. He’d seen it the day before with Paul\nMorrissey at Susan Pile’s big screening at the Picwood Theater—Jack\nNicholson and Warren Beatty and Julie Christie went, 750 people.\nFred and I went back to the hotel to get ready for Sue Mengers’s dinner\nparty in Bel Air. Picked up Diana. Ryan and Tatum were at Sue’s, and\nBarbra Streisand and Jon Peters. Diana went over and told Barbra off about\nsomething. Candy Bergen and Roman Polanski were there. It was a party\nfor Sidney Lumet. He hates me and his wife Gail doesn’t know whether she\ndoes or not, but she follows what her husband does so she’s cold. Sidney\nruns around kissing everybody and then stops when he gets to me. Film\ndirectors used to be such macho guys, and now they’re these little fairy-type\nguys running around French-style double-kissing but still thinking they’re\nmacho.\nJoanne Woodward and Paul Newman sat with Fred during dinner and\nthey said they wanted to come down to the office. Lillian Hellman was\nthere. Roman said Gene Hackman wanted to meet me, but Diana didn’t\nknow who he was and didn’t want to go over. She told Roman that Gene\nshould come over and he did, and he was darling, and Diana still couldn’t\nplace him although she’d seen The French Connection.\nMarisa was there with her hubby, the gossip was that they’d had a big\nfight and broken up. But the big event of the evening was when the maid\ncame in with extra food and fell completely across the room. Sue looked\nconcerned but I think she was just worried about getting sued. It was just\nlike watching a movie. The food was flying all over everybody. She must\nhave really hurt herself but she got up and pretended nothing had happened.\nShe was around fifty, glasses.\nThen went to Alana Hamilton’s party for Mick Flick, and she had\neverybody there. Diana was getting drunker and drunker, and Fred, too.\nValerie Perrine, Tony Curtis, and Nelson Lyon, sober, were there. Ron\nWood invited me to Top of the Rox but I wanted to go home. Diana was\ngetting jealous because Fred was with Jacqueline Bisset, he didn’t know\nJackie’s French boyfriend was there with her. Diana told Fred time to leave\nand he said no, and she got really upset and left and I took her home and\nshe wanted me to go up and discuss Fred with her over drinks and I just\nsaid no and ran out. She thinks she has something going with him."

Peter Lester called and made a date for us to\ninterview William Katt, the star of Carrie, and his press agent at the Polo\nLounge at 1:00.\nTalked to William Katt. His father was movie star Bill Williams and his\nmother Barbara Hale was Della Street on Perry Mason. A good interview.\nThen sat in the lobby for a second and met Liv Ullmann.\nThe place was really jumping with stars all getting ready to go to the\nAcademy Awards. At 4:00 I went to Fred’s room to photograph Willie\nShoemaker the jockey. Richard Weisman’s commissioned me to do a series\nof athletes’ portraits. Richard will keep some of the portraits and some will\nbe for sale and the athletes will get to keep some. So Willie was the first\nathlete. Had to get some film (cab to Schwab’s $3, film $15.30—lost slip).\nWillie’s wife called from the lobby and she came up with a girlfriend—but\nwithout Willie. He didn’t show up till ten after 5:00 and when he saw her,\nhe couldn’t believe she was there. He’d been in court getting a divorce from\nher, that’s why he was late.\nWillie’s ex-wife of one hour was one of the tallest women I’ve ever\nseen. She was dressing Willie for the picture and he looked like an eight-\nyear-old kid. And guess what he was wearing—little Jockey shorts! Ordered\nmartinis, and the wife was drinking. She kept asking him for a date to\ncelebrate the divorce and he kept turning her down, he said, “If I’d known\nyou were going to be here I wouldn’t have come.”\nAlana Hamilton called to invite us to an Academy Awards party at Dani\nJanssen’s. I missed Ronee Blakley’s invitation to go to the Oscars ceremony\nwith her because I was in Fred’s room.\nGot picked up at 7:45 by Alana Hamilton. Drove to Century City. They\nwere having a $10 bet pool on the Academy Awards and it cost me $20.\nBrand-new apartment building, very rich, overlooking all of Hollywood.\nDani’s getting a divorce from David, Alana’s getting a divorce from\nGeorge.\nJack Haley said Liza was in Detroit with her show and coming back the\nnext day. Dick Sylbert was there. Valerie Perrine told me her life story, she\nwas once a chip hustler in Las Vegas and on the verge of marrying some\nrich guy after eight years but he shot himself accidentally. Her eyes teared\nup, she was unhappy. When Martin Scorsese came in she ran over to rustle\nup a job.\nBurgess Meredith came with his date. Rocky got Best Picture. Peter\nFinch got Best Actor, but he’s dead. Nelson Lyon was in the audience as the\ndate of Mrs. Finch, Eletha. She’s very black. The Academy asked Paddy\nChayevsky go up to accept Peter Finch’s award. Burgess and I talked about\nhis ex-wife, Paulette.\nBrenda Vaccaro was upset because her ex-fiancé Michael Douglas was\nthere with his brand-new wife that he met at the inauguration. James Caan\nwas there with his boyish wife, a beauty. They’re all marrying younger girls\nwho look like they’re thirteen, the Hollywood thing. Roman was there, he’s\nout on bail now for the thirteen-year-old-girl. He jumped on Alana’s ass and\nsaid he was going to rape her.\nMartin Scorsese with his wife, Julia. Jackie Bisset. Lee Grant. Burt\nYoung from Rocky. A girl from Big Valley, Linda Evans, really beautiful.\nTony Curtis was giving people puffs on his marijuana.\nJulia Scorsese said that Martin would take me and Fred in his limo. She\nwas drunk, screaming something about death threats, but I didn’t know\nwhat she was talking about.\nAs we got into the car Martin said he had a bomb threat, the note said\nthat he would die one minute after midnight if Jodie Foster won the\nAcademy Award. It was 2:00 now and he was going to MGM to work on\nNew York, New York in the dark and deserted MGM lot, alone. I was\nparanoid. Esther Phillips was calling me at the hotel but I didn’t answer the\ncalls because she’s started to scare me—one of her calls was at 2 A.M."

Paddy Chayevsky told the stewardess he wanted to sleep all during the\ntrip, not to wake him up, but he woke up five minutes after the plane was in\nthe air.\nJohn Travolta kept going to the bathroom, coming out with his eyes\nbright red, drinking orange juice and liquor in a paper cup, and he put his\nhead in a pillow and started crying.

She says, “I just want one big room,” but when she moves\nall her furniture in, it won’t even look or feel big at all. And it costs\n$32,000.\nVictor and his boyfriend walked me back to the office. A fortune teller\ntold Victor’s boyfriend that he would be hit by a cab. Then she said maybe\nthat wasn’t right, that she’d better read the tarot cards, too, so she did, and\nthen she said, “It’s going to happen even quicker than I thought.” So now\nthe kid is really worried. She charged him $5 and first he said, “I’m not\ngoing to pay you for telling me that,” and she said he had to so he did. How\ncould a person do that! I mean, that’s the kind of thing that really really\nreally stays in your mind. The reason the kid went there in the first place\nwas because his friends had told him she was so good. To make him feel\nbetter all I could think to say was that maybe she could see he was a\ncareless person and had told him that to make him more careful.\nI was invited to Diane Von Furstenberg’s dinner for Sue Mengers. Went\nhome, glued myself together, cab to DVF’s ($2.25). It was a very heavy\nnewspaper-reporter dinner. Mr. Grunwald from Time magazine, Nora\nEphron—didn’t see her husband, Carl Bernstein, though—Helen Gurley\nBrown and her husband David, Irene Selznick, and DVF’s boyfriend, Barry\nDiller. I was feeling very talkative so I talked and I talked, but nobody\nlistened to anything I said, they just ignored me. I know that Diller doesn’t\nlike me, so I worked hard to change his mind but he was still awful to me.\nBianca was there. I thought she’d already left for Paris. She was saying\nout loud everything I was thinking—what two bitches Diane Von\nFurstenberg and Sue Mengers were—and she said, “At least Sue can be\nfunny sometimes.” Sue was on her way to Europe to meet her husband, who\nonly lets her see him once every couple of months, I think.\nI told Irene Selznick that I’d seen a great picture of her at George\nCukor’s. I was raving about California so much that everybody thinks I’m\nmoving there.\nHelen Gurley Brown sat at my feet and I talked to her about California.\nBianca was talking about how boring all these people were to Mr.\nGrunwald, she didn’t know who he was, and then after he went away I told\nher. They were all two-faced people there, and Diane only invited me to pay\nme back for the Interview cover, and I mean, who cared. Diane is very\nskinny. Dino De Laurentiis came late with his wife, Silvana Mangano, she\nwas wearing a white Oscar de la Renta and said she was cold.\nEgon Von Furstenberg came in with his girlfriend, the one that used to\ncome to the Factory who I can’t stand, and I guess she finally realizes that I\nhate her, because she didn’t say anything to me. Her name starts with M,\nsomething like Marita. He’ll never marry her.\nBianca said she wanted to go dancing and called her answering service\nbut there was nothing on it so she stayed. She was wearing a thrift-store\ndress that she got in California that was really beautiful. When the De\nLaurentiises walked by us to leave she said, “They’re full of shit.” I left\nalone.

Sissy’s mother was there and she said hello and went into the\nother room to read Interview, and then Bob got nervous because he thought\nSissy was fifteen and her mother would see the nude photograph we ran of\nYul Brynner when he was young—that famous old photo. But Sissy’s really\ntwenty-seven and she’s married, her mother was just with her, not\nchaperoning her.

I thought it couldn’t be anything\ngreat so I was forty-five minutes late ($3). The first person I saw when I\nwalked in the door was Jackie O., looking beautiful. Then Norman Mailer.\nJackie was talking to Jean’s boyfriend who works for the Smithsonian.\nDelfina Rattazzi who still works for Jackie at Viking was there with such a\ncomplete new look I didn’t recognize her—curly hair and a sexy dress.\nSue Mengers was there, and she came over to me and said her knees\nwere buckling, that she’d never been to a party like this. Babe Paley and her\nchairman-of-CBS husband went by, and later when I saw Sue and Paley\nsitting together I remembered what Sue had told me in California, that the\nonly job she ever wanted was Paley’s.\nI told Norman Mailer I loved him on the Academy Awards and he said\nhe’d just seen a video of how fast he’d come down the ramp—Billy\nFriedkin had told him to do it that way. Renata Adler who writes for the\nNew Yorker was there with Avedon. She said she’s going to law school now\nat Yale but she thinks she’ll maybe drop out. She says it’s so hard, and that\nshe can’t remember anything.\nI had the first really nice talk with Jackie O. but I don’t remember too\nmuch what it was about. The Magic of People in the Movies, or something.\nSue Mengers was running around this party bragging the same thing that\nshe always brags—that she could offer President Carter a three-picture deal\nat $3 million a picture and that he’d take it, because everybody wants to be\nin the movies. So I pointed at Jackie and told Sue to go prove it, but she was\nafraid, she wouldn’t go over to her and make the offer. Andrew Young from\nthe U.N. and another black guy were there. Sue was thrilled to meet them.\nDennis Hopper told me he’s directing Junkie, the William Burroughs\nbio, and I made a faux pas by telling him he should use Mick for the star\nbecause then Dennis said that he was the star.\nA son of Nick Dunne was there, trying to be an actor now. Then Earl\ntook me into the back rooms of the house, and there were ten girls around\nseventeen or eighteen, full-grown, the age of Jean’s daughter who’s in\ncollege, and they were like having a slumber party, guessing at who was out\nthere at the “grownup” party! But these girls were so old, it was funny.\nThey were thrilled to see me, I signed the TV, the armoire, their hands,\neverything. Every half-hour they’d let one girl out and into the party.\nDropped off Nick Dunne’s son on 90th and Central Park West (cab $5).\nFriday, April 15,1977\nWe had our first nut at 860 yesterday—Diane Coffman came up. We’ve had\nnuts before but not one that we knew. She was in our play, Pork, in ‘70 or\n‘71. The director, Tony Ingrassia, must have discovered her. She kept\nsaying, “You know how to spell Coffman? C-O-F-F-M-A-N.” Had to give\nher money ($10).\nLunch was for Diana Vreeland and an Argentinian woman, and Bob had\ninvited Michael and Pat York. Carole Rogers and Sally from Interview had\ninvited a hi-fi girl to try to sell her ads. The girl was impressed with Diana\nand the Yorks, she thought she was just going to have lunch with Carole and\nSally. Diana was saying that she’d discovered the museum had turned the\nlights up and the music down on her Russian costume show—they said it\nwas because some people had complained they couldn’t see anything and\nthe music was too loud. Diana said that you don’t go change something\nbecause somebody asks you to, that that’s the trouble with this country, they\nwant to “give the public what it wants.” “Well,” she said, “the public wants\nwhat it can’t get, and it’s up to museums to teach them what to want.” And\nshe said that’s the trouble with Vogue magazine and all the other magazines\ntoday—except for Interview, she said."

      "text": "Got to the St. Regis at 11:30 for the Jewish Anti-Defamation League\ntestimonial to Elizabeth Taylor. Liz and Halston weren’t there yet. I met the\npresident of Cartier. Eugenia Sheppard was there. Hermione Gingold was\nthere. A woman who didn’t even have to say she was Bob Feiden’s mother\ncame over to me and said that, because she looked just like Bob Feiden but\nwith jewelry. John Springer and Liz and Halston arrived. There were two or\nthree Liz lookalikes there, one introduced herself to Liz.\nI was next to Mary Beame, the wife of Mayor Abe Beame. There were a\nfew anti-defamation people on the dais, and Hal Prince and Mike Todd, Jr.\nLiv Ullmann led the prayer, and Diane Von Furstenberg was there. Livia\nWeintraub who was good-looking gave a speech about being in a\nconcentration camp, and she ended it with a plug for her new perfume,\n“Livia.” She gave Liz one of the first batch of 50. Dore Schary was there,\nhe founded the league. It was rotten food— gold salmon.\nThen they gave Liz the plaque which had raw amethyst all over it—the\nstuff ashtrays are made of—it was of Mt. Sinai and at the top in gold was\nthe Ten Commandments. Liz was in river purple, she got up and gave a\nlittle speech, very breathy and sincere, like, “I’m just like all of you—when\nI care about something, I do something about it, we’re all like that, thank\nyou so much.” John Warner was there. Then she and Halston got up off the\ndais to make a trip to the bathroom and one of the ladies at Bob’s table\nwondered, “Why are they both going to the bathroom?” And another lady\nsaid, “Maybe she ripped her dress and Halston’s going to sew it for her.”\nCabbed downtown because we had to meet Bella Abzug at the office to\nphotograph her for the cover of Rolling Stone ($4.25).\nBella was there with her daughter, (laughs) another dyke. Oh I’m\nkidding, but you know what I mean—a chip off the same block. I took\npictures of Bella smelling a rose. Jann Wenner came down.\nCabbed to La Petite Ferme, a little restaurant in the Village where\nGeorge Mason was having a dinner for me. Catherine and her brother\nValentine were waiting for us out in the rain. All the boys in the family are\nraving beauties, but the girls are like Catherine—just cute.\nThen I talked everybody into going up to Studio 54 for the party for\nBeatlemania. Aerosmith was there, and Cyrinda Foxe from Bad who used\nto live with David Johansen but now she lives with one of Aerosmith. She\nsaid that a picture of me with a Campbell’s Soup Can was in the light show\nof Beatlemania."

You get up your nerve to go\nfor a test—you pop the question—and then pretty soon it can be all over,\nthey give you the answer and you pop off. So I’ll let My Dear Diary know\nsoon if the days are numbered.\nWent to the office ($4) with a bandage on my neck. Bob was\ninterviewing Barbara Allen, the next Interview cover girl, on Men, Women,\nand Love. Tom Beard [a member of Carter’s inaugural committee] brought\na really interesting guy called Joel McCleary, who’s the treasurer of the\nDemocratic National Committee, and he’s around thirty-five. He was the\nnational finance chairman of the Carter campaign. He’s trying to get the\nDalai Lama back into this country. He said a lot of Tibetan monks work in a\nprophylactic company in Paterson, New Jersey, that they take the bus and\ngo make prophylactics. And Barbara Allen said, “You know, that’s true, a\nlot of prophylactics do say ‘Made in New Jersey.’ “\nWent over to visit Victor at his new loft, which just has a bed in the\nmiddle with big jars of different kinds of Vaseline around it—he’s so much\nlike Ondine."

But it was like Suddenly, Last Summer—I was his\nprop to go cruising, the boys would come over to talk to me and Victor\nwould get them. We sat at the Riviera Lounge for four hours having coffees\nand teas ($7).\nWent home, called Julia Scorsese at the Sherry Netherland—she’d called\nme—and she said to hold on and then she was gone for ten minutes. Then\nshe came back on and said to hold on some more and was gone for another\nten minutes. Then Liza Minnelli got on the phone and said, “This is Liza,\nlet me have your number and she’ll call you right back.” And then Julia\ncalled and said to come over for dinner. I said I was with Catherine and her\nbrother that evening and she said to bring them.\nCabbed to Sherry ($2). As we were going in, a guy with a beard was\ngetting into the elevator. Mr. and Mrs. Scorsese, Martin’s parents, were\nthere. They’re taller than he is, which is unusual, because kids are usually\ntaller than their parents. There were a couple of agents. His parents live\ndowntown right below Ballato’s. There was a nurse with a beautiful baby. It\nwas a nurse that Julia had just hired, and she’d gotten lost in the airport so\nJulia was worried that she wasn’t a good one. There was a Negro girl with a\nbaby, too, and the guy with the beard turned out to be Bobby De Niro and\nthis Negro girl was his wife, Diahnne Abbott.\nMarty’s skinny now, he’s been on a diet. Jack Haley was running\naround. Liza was wearing the dress Halston made out of fabric based on my\nFlower paintings. Marty came out in a white outfit and then changed into a\nblack outfit. Everyone went downstairs to eat. Roger Moore was with them,\nand a girl from U.A. who was doing publicity, she was kissing Roger.\nRoger Moore was wonderful and charming. He showed us what he\ncalled his three expressions: “worried,” “eyebrow up,” and “eyebrow\ndown.” He’s been married three times, he’s married to an Italian woman\nnow.\nBobby De Niro came in after dinner with an agent with funny glasses,\ndidn’t say much. Marty’s parents were there really late.\nEverybody got really really drunk. They were wanting me to make a\ntoast, and I was so drunk I actually stood up and said something and it came\nout right I guess because everybody kept saying how moving it was, but I\nwas so drunk I can’t remember what I said. Liza kept saying, “I’ll tell this\nto my grandchildren—and I’ve forgotten everything else!”\nIt was the best party. I stole a copy of the record album of New York,\nNew York because Valentine wanted it, and Roger Moore had written\nbackwards on it, and then I felt bad because they saw me do it. I was\npopping painkillers because of the neck operation from last week, the\nbiopsy. I haven’t found out yet. When we left the Sherry it was dawn\noutside, six o’clock (cab $3.50)."

I wanted to buy this one tree that looked beautiful,\nand at first they said they wouldn’t sell it to me because it would only live\none more day, but I said that was all it had to do—I knew Julia and Liza\nwouldn’t be in town long.\nCabbed downtown and then walked to office ($3.50).

She sang a song and looked beautiful, but it didn’t\nbelong in the movie, had nothing to do with it.\nWent to the Sherry and the party was jammed. Every time we wanted to\nleave, Julia said to stay. She was saying things like, “Please be Martin’s best\nboyfriend because he doesn’t have friends.” Somewhere in his New York\ndays Martin must have gotten something into his head about me, because it\nseems to mean something big to have me there and be together, it’s like it\nsymbolizes something, but I can’t figure out exactly what yet.\nWe’d told a friend of Valentine’s to meet us at the party but he never\nshowed up, so we took a cab to the Stanhope to find him ($2.50). Room 15-\nsomething. We knocked on the door and he said, “I’ll be there in a minute.”\nThis went on for a while. The room is 2’ X 2’‘. Valentine was getting so\nnervous he was beating his head.

Victor was taking\ncoke in the seat next to me, though, so that woke me up at the end—a little\nof it drifted over. Walked over to the Rainbow Room.\nThere was a black guy at the door of the Rainbow Room who didn’t\nknow me and wouldn’t let me in and then another guy came to the door and\nit turned out to be this guy who always tells me that he wants his lobster pot\nback. He came to my house with a bunch of people once and says he\nbrought a lobster pot that he cooked in and then he says it’s still at my\nhouse and I don’t ever know what he’s talking about. I go crazy every time\nthis guy starts up because it’s always the same routine! If he sees me in\nthirty years it will still be: “Give me back my lobster pot.” So he came out\nand said, “Oh, come right in, Mr. Warhol,” and at first I didn’t recognize\nhim and as soon as we got in the door he turned on me and said, “Where’s\nmy lobster pot!” and I thought, Oh this just can’t be happening to me again.\nOh no, oh no no no no no no.... Then the guy had to go back to the door and\nwe got away.\nWe didn’t go into the main room because I didn’t know what happened\nto it, I didn’t see it. We went into the side room and then Julia Scorsese\ncame over and said, “Hold on to me, grab me, talk to me,” like come\nhere/go there/turn around/don’t leave me—she’s just like Susan Tyrrell and\nSally Kirkland, sort of that type.\nThen she said, “Don’t look now, there’s Martin’s first wife, and I just get\ncrazy when she’s around.” And the girl was very beautiful. I didn’t know\nthat Martin had been married before, I was surprised because he’s so\nCatholic and always has the priest around and everything. The girl said,\n“You don’t remember me, but I met you when I was the head of the Erotica\nGallery.” Then we left her and I introduced Julia to Earl Wilson.\nI noticed that in the movie were lots of the people who actually work for\nMarty. Like the woman in the car who has the fight with Bobby and Liza is\nthe wife of the agent. That’s why it’s good—the parts were written for the\npeople.\nJulia asked me to sit at the main table with her and Marty, but there was\na big crowd and noise so I sort of pretended I didn’t hear that because I\nwanted to slip away—it wasn’t my night, it was their night.\nVictor left and I was so worried about him, he was strange, and seemed\nbored, and for the first time since I’ve known him he seemed real. Like he\nwas very tired and a normal person and wanted to go home. And he did.\nWent over to Studio 54. The band struck up “New York, New York” and\nthey carried Liza in. Halston did photos with her. Then a little later they\nplayed “New York, New York” and Martin walked in, and I think maybe\nthey carried Liza in again or picked her up again, but I was leaving.\nDropped Valentine ($3).

Jerry was saying, “I really have to go,” and when\nPeter was going to go with her to get a cab she said, “Oh, that’s all right,\nMick will drop me off.”\nThen we went next door for a continuing party for Egon, this one given\nat New York/New York by Diane de Beauvau. Franco Rossellini was there\nwith a big black and blue nose, and you couldn’t see anything but that, but I\nwanted to be discreet in case somebody had hit him, so I ignored it until\nFranco said finally, “By the way, have you noticed my nose?

Stan Rumbough was going to the dinner, too, and that got me\nexcited, he’s the young rich Post Toasties son of Dina Merrill. Dina is in A\nWedding, the Robert Altman movie that they’re filming in Chicago. It just\nhas a little bit of a storyline. Altman’s doing all the things we tried to do in\nthe late sixties and early seventies.\nGeorge Mason picked me up. Stan Rumbough is very big, about 6’3\",\nand he’s handsome, but he talks like a fairy. I’ve seen him a few times with\ncheap, sort of Oriental-looking girls. He’s got a high, nelly voice, but I\nguess he likes beautiful girls—he was disappointed that Candy Bergen\ncancelled out, he said he’d gone swimming with her when he was seven\nyears old and wanted to see her again.\nIt was an Armenian-Turkish-African-Arabian-type restaurant. Mashed\nchickpeas, mashed eggplant, three guys playing music. George had his\nmodel girlfriend Maret from Finland there.\nBarbara Allen was there. She still just really hates her Interview cover.\nThe man with the new model agency came, he brought about five girls and\nboys. Valentine was in heaven. The owners came over a lot and took\npictures. A nun came over to me to autograph a bottle but my pen didn’t\nwork. She said she’d just gotten out of an operation and that seeing me was\nthe most exciting moment of her life since she won $500 in the church\nlottery, (laughs) I mean, if these are high points for a nun …\nStan Rumbough seemed to like Barbara and was saying something that\nsounded like “blow job” a lot and blowing into a bottle. Philip Niarchos is\nprobably not going to marry her, so she should get him worried, or\nsomething like that. She should live with him and get more things before he\ndrops her.\nStan says he’s a “photographer.” These rich kids, it’s so funny to hear\nthem sit there and say, “I have a job, oh yes, doing pictures for a catalogue,\nI work for a man who does catalogues, and this is the second time I’ve been\nto Brooklyn—the first was yesterday, I came here to pick up some wax fruit\nto shoot….” I asked him if he wanted to do pictures for Interview. I mean,\nDina interviewed herself just to get Stan’s picture of her published. And he\nsaid, “I’m in a busy time now, what with the catalogue work….”\nThen on to Earl McGrath’s party for the Star Wars people—Mark\nHamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and another girl, but by the time I got\nto 57th and Seventh they were gone (cab $8).\nMacKenzie Phillips asked Vincent, “Got any blow?” Jann Wenner was\nthere and I introduced him to Stan Rumbough, but Stan is so stupid-\nsounding and I forgot to clue Jann who he was, so Jann probably thought he\nwas just some kid who took pictures of waxed fruit, because that’s all he\nwas talking about again.\nGood food. Fran Lebowitz and Marc Balet were there, they may have\ncome with Jerry Hall and Bryan Ferry. Jerry seemed to be back with him.\nEarl showed a videotape of the Sex Pistols.\nBarbara and Stan and I left together, and when I left them they were still\ntogether.\nFriday, July 1,1977\nSuzie Frankfurt and Jed left early for Montauk in order to spruce it up for\nthe prospective renters.\nVictor invited me over to Halston’s house for dinner. Halston had gone\nto Joe Eula’s for the weekend in upstate New York, and he lets Victor use\nhis house on 63rd Street while he’s away but he never tells him when he’s\ncoming back, just to keep Victor on his toes. So Victor invited lots of people\nfor dinner with me. One of them was Peter Keating, a top male model. His\nhair is receding, but he didn’t start to get popular until it started to recede,\nhe thinks it’s because this way he doesn’t “pose a threat” to men.\nVictor made a chicken. The house was freezing and I was the only one\ncold because everyone else was taking coke. Halston has a freezer stacked\nfull of vodka, so it’s like drinking liquid oil. I had about four small glasses.\nAlso there were a couple of John Waters people from Baltimore. The one\nguy who looked like a heavier John Waters said that he was Divine’s\nroommate. I asked if he and Divine were lovers and he said, “Well, after all\nthese years, you really fall in love with the mind….” Victor said he’d made\nit with someone in a van in front of Halston’s, because they weren’t sure\nwhen Halston was coming back."

I started saying people act like it’s\nthe directors and the producers and the writers who make a movie when it’s\nactually the stars, and she took offense saying her husband had created\nBobby De Niro and Harvey Keitel and some other people. But I said they\nwere new faces and people always want to see new faces. Marty is now in\nChicago doing a musical called Shine It On with Liza.\nShe said that she gave Robert Altman the idea to film A Wedding in\nChicago, to take it out of L.A. and give it a different atmosphere. The\nproducers gave her three days off, she said, so I took that to mean she must\nhave been driving them crazy. Julia was getting a little too drunk. She\ndumped her pocketbook on the table and all the credit cards spilled out. She\nwent to the bathroom and I put them back in (dinner $70)."

She’s so awful (cab total $7).\nThey’re saying that the article Caroline Kennedy did on the Elvis funeral\nfor Rolling Stone made fun of the local people, but I can understand that—\nCaroline’s really intelligent and the people down there really were dumb.\nElvis never knew there were more interesting people.\nWhen I got to 12th Street I walked around University Place for ideas.\nThen over to the office. Sandy Brant was there with Jed going over\ndecorating schemes for Peter Brant and Joe Allen’s office building in\nGreenwich that Philip Johnson designed. Jed’s in the decorating business\nnow.\nCab to Alkit Camera ($3) on 53rd and Third. The cab driver didn’t even\nturn around to look at me but he knew who I was. I asked him how he could\ntell. He said that he’d been buying art since he was twenty and just\n“stacking it around the house like the Collyer Brothers.” He went to\nauctions and places for art bargains, and he was thrilled to have me in the\ncab. I got a new camera because I had to take pictures of Chrissie Evert\nlater in the afternoon. For the Athletes series.\nHad Bettina, the famous Chanel model from the fifties, to lunch. She’s\nthe beautiful one who was in the car with Aly Khan when he died. She’s\nhere to open an Ungaro store on Madison around the corner from my house.\nShe was wearing a purple dress.\nChrissie said she and Burt Reynolds were talking about me recently, and\nthat’s why she wanted to do this. Victor came in and he started dragging out\nthe Shadow paintings of cocks and assholes that I’ve been doing—the\npaintings all the “landscapes” have been posing for—and somebody had to\ntell him not to. I gave her a copy of the Burt Reynolds issue of Interview."

Doug’s\nassistant, Hilary, told me the workers were surprised when they saw that my\npaintings were closeups of naked bodies and I guess they didn’t think that\nwas good art because they started to make jokes and compare the cocks\nwith their own and they didn’t do much work.

I was so happy to go to a big fun party after that\nhorrible dinner (cab $2.50).\nPeter Beard was at Studio 54 and for the first time I saw him so drunk\nthat his words were slurring.

I told him not to be\nrelieved, that he had to do more. Sterling St. Jacques was there, he said he\nhas a part in The Wiz—he and Pat Cleveland have broken up.

This is for the lawsuit we’re bringing against\nher husband Carlo Ponti, who produced Frankenstein and Dracula [see\nIntroduction]. They were completely serious.

Then we went to the motel Vitas\nsaid to. It was almost a dump but it was okay, like every other motel, like\nbeing at a Holiday Inn, with a pool and everything.\nAs soon as we checked in there, we went to another motel, the one that\nJack Nicklaus owned, to meet him.\nWe waited while he talked on the phone. He looked fat, but Richard said\nthat he was once 280 and was now down to 180. He was very suntanned,\nbut his eyes, around them, were white where his sunglasses were, and his\nhands were tiny and white, he wears gloves on the course. His hair was\nblond, and he said something about needing a haircut, but I had the feeling\nthat his hair was just the way it always looked, puffed just-so over the ears,\nlike it was “coifed.”\nI started taking pictures but none of them were coming out good. It’s so\nhard taking pictures of suntanned people because they come out so red. He\nwas being friendly and Richard was trying to be friendly but somehow the\nsituation was strained, he didn’t understand what was going on. And I had\nmy tape recorder with me and was taping, but when I sort of realized that he\nwouldn’t understand that, I just quietly shut it off. Richard’s secretary\nClaudia showed him pictures I’d done of Tom Seaver, Muhammad Ali, and\nPelé, but he still didn’t really understand why we were there taking pictures\nof him. Richard had sent him a book showing my paintings but he didn’t\nunderstand the style.\nAnd then he got another phone call, and we were getting nervous and I\ntook some more pictures and he didn’t like any and we didn’t like any. Not\ngetting good pictures made things more and more awkward and finally he\nsaid, “Well, you know what you want—you don’t tell me how to tee off on\nthe green,” and I felt more uncomfortable and everyone just wished we\ncould leave. Then finally he liked one but it was just nothing, a front shot,\nand I didn’t see any difference between the rest of them and that one, but he\nsaid he didn’t want to be looking—what’s the word? It’s like cocky, but it’s\na short word—he didn’t want to look like that, and he thought this one\nmade him look like a nice person. He talked about his wife and his kids.\nForgot to say that when I was taking the pictures, there wasn’t a golf\nclub around, they were all down on the course. He went around to some of\nthe offices asking if anyone had clubs and finally came back with some that\nhe said were just like his, and I didn’t know that golf clubs have hats on\nthem with drawstrings.\nWe ran out and dished the whole thing in the car and that’s when it\nsuddenly occurred to me that he actually had looked like he might be lonely\nand maybe we should have invited him out with us, but he hadn’t suggested\nanything himself, and nobody just knew what to do, so nothing happened.\nWe looked around for a place to have dinner. Fred and I wanted to go back\nto New York right after taking the pictures but the only flight out went to\nAtlanta first.\nWe saw a building with about twenty floors and there was a restaurant at\nthe top that moved around in a circle. We decided not to go to that, and then\ndecided that we would go there after all. It had some name like River\nHouse. It was next to a Howard Johnson’s. We went up in the elevator and\nsat down in the restaurant, and it began to revolve. There were ladies there\nplaying harps.\nThen we went back to Richard’s room with him to wait for the girls that\nwere coming at 12:00 and had tequila with him. When the girls called on\nthe phone he asked them to bring some jeans and a T-shirt for Claudia,\nbecause they would all go nightclubbing and she hadn’t brought anything to\nwear.\nClaudia used to be an airline stewardess and I guess that’s where\nRichard met her. She’s very pretty and she’s the best secretary. She just does\neverything.\nThe girls arrived and they looked like New York models, very tall and\nblonde and pretty and they were wearing the same kind of clothes, jeans\nand T-shirts.\nOne of the girls was more the hustler and she went after Richard. All\nthey could talk about was Vitas so they called him in New York. The clothes\nthey brought for Claudia fit perfectly.\nFred and I went to our rooms. They were big and clean and everything,\nbut you’d wake up every half-hour because of the air conditioning. I slept in\nmy clothes because I knew there was a six o’clock wake-up call."

She said she fell asleep\nwith her soft contacts in and ruined her eyes for a while, and she can’t find\nher glasses. Joel Grey’s daughter Jennifer was there, too. When Valentino\nheard I was going up later to interview Sophia Loren he said that she was\nthe stingiest person, that she went to his place and wanted a 70 percent\ndiscount and he said goodbye.\nCabbed up to the Pierre with Victor and Robert Hayes in rush hour ($4).\nWent to the thirty-sixth floor to see Sophia. On the way in the cab I warned\nVictor everything he shouldn’t talk about, like that we were suing her\nhusband.\nJohn Springer met us. Sophia came out looking beautiful. Then she kept\ntelling us how poor she was, it was so ridiculous. Like we asked her if she\nwore Valentino clothes and she said oh no, that they were much too\nexpensive for her, and she said she wouldn’t be able to afford to stay at a\nplace like the Pierre herself—that the movie people were paying for it. Like\nshe didn’t mention that she could have stayed right down the street in her\nown apartment in the Hampshire House. But Victor was fun, he opened\nchampagne and said he saw all her movies in Venezuela when he was a\nbaby. I’d told Victor he couldn’t say any dirty words, because when we\nwent to Carlo Ponti’s villa in Rome a few years ago they told us that Sophia\ndidn’t allow any dirty words in her house and that we’d get kicked out if we\nsaid any. Well, the running thing while we were at the Pierre, it turned out,\nwas that Sophia kept saying “fuck.” She and Marcello Mastroianni are on\nthe front page of the Post for being on the new Dick Cavett interview show\non channel 13 and Marcello said, “You have to fuck a lot,” when Dick\nasked him how do you be a Latin Lover. Sophia seemed to think that was so\n“cute,” so she was repeating it. After about an hour she wanted to get rid of\nus, and we ran out."

      "text": "Had a bad night. Woke up at 6:00, fell back asleep, up again at 8:00 and\n9:00, turned on the TV and watched all the cartoons. Archie and Amos were\nstill away, they’d gone out to Montauk with Jed—we’re still trying to rent\nthe place.\nDiana Vreeland called and said someone should talk to Fred about his\ndrinking problem, to tell him he’s so attractive but that when he’s drunk\nhe’s so unattractive.\nStevie Rubell called and said he had tickets to the Lillian Carter dinner\nat the Waldorf. I had to get into black tie again but the bottoms always itch\nso much, that’s why I wear bluejeans usually with the black-tie top. But\ntonight I innovated something, I put the black pants on over my bluejeans\nand it didn’t really look lumpy, it worked, so I walked out of the house in\ntwo pairs of pants at 6:15. Cabbed to the Waldorf ($2.50). When I got there\nStevie was nowhere around.\nA boy took me to a small room on the side where there was a reception\nfor Miz Lillian. She was wearing a blue sort-of-nightie and she was really\nthrilled to see me, she loved the pictures I’d done of her, and she invited me\nto the party in her room afterwards. She told me it was 7-N. Finally Stevie\ncame in, he’d just had a joint, he said, because these things made him so\nnervous. He said he’d never been with so many other Jews before. It was\nthe Synagogues of America— something like that—giving a medal to her.\nThen we went into the big room. I was at table 3. There were about\nthirty-five Jews on stage. The Edgar Bronfman guy—the kidnappee’s father\n—paid for the dinner. He talked very classy— if you closed your eyes you\nthought it was Dick Cavett—and he was the only one who had a pretty\nyoung wife who didn’t look Jewish. Andrew Young came over and shook\nmy hand, he looks like a butch Johnny Mathis. Then we had gefilte fish,\nand it was a dairy dinner. While we ate they gave speeches and they sang\n“God Bless America” in English and Jewish. The cantor had a very good\nvoice. It went on for hours. Andrew Young gave a speech about the United\nNations and freedom. The food looked like airplane food. The best line of\nthe evening was when Miss Lillian said, “I’ve never met so many Jews in\nmy life. I must tell Jimmy.” Everyone was so shocked they laughed. She\nwas good, nervous. There were autographed copies of her book Away From\nHome at every place and I stole an extra one because Richard Kiley hadn’t\nshown up.\nSo Stevie and I left the Waldorf and went out to look for his car, parked\non Lexington. A $30,000 Mercedes. He says it’s his only big enjoyment in\nlife, having a car and parking wherever he wants to, spending money on\nparking tickets. He said he has money in shoeboxes. He says we should go\naround to discos together because he has to pick up boys to work at Studio\n54.\nBob Weiner is doing his first big story for New York and it’s on Stevie\nand Studio 54. Bob Weiner seems like he’s in love with Stevie. (laughs)\nDeeply. Bob used to be so straight, producing Broadway plays and then\naround ‘69 he became a hippie type and started listening to rock and roll\nand writing for that dirty newspaper that was like Screw.\nAt the party at The Ginger Man for the opening of the New York Film\nFestival, Leticia Kent was there and John Springer who gave the party, and\nMarcello Mastroianni and Gerard Depardieu who looked wonderful. He\nasked me for a French cigarette and I told him I didn’t have one but that I\ncould get him a Quaalude, so I went over to Stevie and he gave me one to\ntake and I broke it into fourths and then didn’t take it. But Stevie kept\nsaying, “You didn’t take your Quaalude.” They don’t forget—people on\ndrugs really do remember. So I let him see me taking part of it.\nThen I saw Howard Smith from the Voice so I went over to say hello.\nHoward’s been writing letters to Valerie Solanis, that’s the latest thing, he\nmust have run into her in the Village. He told me he was sorry he’d started\nthat, that he doesn’t know how people that crazy are out in the streets. I told\nhim maybe it was because she worked for the CIA.\nStevie wanted to go to the Village to the clubs, he wants to open one\ndown there. The first place we went to was the Cock Ring. The area has\nchanged, they got rid of the back rooms and the bars are really crowded.\nStevie is Mr. Big down there, he recruits all his waiters from there. Right\nbefore we went into the Cock Ring I took my outer black formal pants off\nand went in my jeans underneath. It was jammed with cute kids dancing.\nThen Stevie gets bored right away everywhere and wants to leave. Went\nto 12 West and I wouldn’t dance, so Stevie danced with a pillow. He kept\ngetting poppers and putting them under my nose. Bob Weiner saw Stevie\nholding the poppers and me sniffing and went out to the car. Later he said\nthat his whole clean innocent image of me was blown, that there I was on\nQuaaludes, taking poppers and drinking. I said, “Did you actually see me\ntake a Quaalude?” Then I showed him the bits of the Quaalude still in my\npocket and I informed him that I hadn’t been inhaling when Stevie put the\npoppers under my nose. Then he said okay, but that I was drinking, and I\nsaid, “I always drink.”\nThen to the Anvil for a minute. There was a colored guy at the door who\ndidn’t want to let Stevie in, he started screaming that Stevie hadn’t let him\ninto Studio 54 and who did he think he was now, trying to get into the\nAnvil, but then he saw me and he waved me in, and he finally let Stevie in,\ntoo, but he made him pay. Upstairs there was “entertainment.” It was a drag\nqueen. Richard Bernstein was there, he told me that Valentino had ordered\nforty portraits from him, then only took two. Remember, he’s the one who\ncalled Sophia Loren the cheapest person in the world for wanting a 70\npercent discount! A part of the show that I did think was funny was a boy\ntaking off fifty pairs of jockey shorts.\nStevie said he had to get up at 8:00 because the restaurant meatman\ncomes on Monday mornings and he has to pick out the meat. He lives in a\nnew building on 55th Street. We got into the car and Stevie dropped me\nhome and I kissed him in front of Bob Weiner so that Bob would have\nsomething else to write about. That was around 5:00."

Dropped off Vincent and Catherine (cab $4). Changed, then\ntook a cab to the Plaza ($2). Met Howard Cosell and his wife and was\nsurprised he was so tall. I liked him, he was fun.\nMy portrait of Pelé was going to be presented. Pelé’s mother and father\nwere there and they were cute, and his wife, who was white, but everybody\nin South America is all different colors— his parents were different colors,\ntoo. After the dinner we went over to P.J. Clarke’s ($2.50). Tucker\nFrederickson, the football player that I like so much, was there. He’s so\nadorable I kept telling him he should do more TV, but he said he didn’t\nwant to. Had a bowl of chili."

      "text": "Talked to Fred. We were arranging to go up to meet Nenna Eberstadt who\nworked at our office all summer for lunch at her school uptown on 83rd\nStreet—Brearley.\nBefore I left the house I happened to talk on the phone to David\nWhitney. David said he hadn’t even started on the Jasper Johns show. Then\nhe told me something that scared me when I heard it, and scared me even\nmore as the day went on. He said that when Rauschenberg was down in\nTexas for a show, all the art people were on a chic art-people charter bus\nand it stopped at a gas station and the men’s room was locked so\nRauschenberg peed on the side of the bus and two Texas Rangers appeared\nand arrested him and took him to jail! I mean if you’re walking along the\nstreet in New York, what if you really have to pee or shit? What do you do?\nDo you have to do it in your pants? Will they arrest you if you do it in the\nstreet? And if you can prove that you really had to go, will they let you go\nbut will you have a criminal record? I guess you have to do it in your pants.\nCabbed up to Brearley with Bob and Fred. Left from the office so I took\na stack of Interviews up with me. When we got to 83rd and First Avenue\n(cab $5) we walked in and left the magazines at the front for the girls to\ntake. I forgot that this wasn’t all a high-school-age place. I was just thinking\nthat all the girls were older, like Nenna. Well, Nenna came to meet us and\nshe looked like she was suddenly ten years old! I couldn’t believe it! In a\nlittle black uniform and one of those skirts, you know that’s short, like—\nwhat’s the name? Like the ladies wore in the sixties … a miniskirt. And her\nfriend was in a uniform, too, a very beautiful girl who also looked ten years\nold. And Fred told us a secret, that Mick Jagger had called Nenna and\nFreddy Eberstadt answered and started screaming at him, “How dare you\ncall a young girl like my daughter? You, an older man of forty!” Mick took\noffense and said “I am not forty. I’m thirty-four. And Nenna goes out with\nMr. Fred Hughes, who is also thirty-four. And besides, I don’t go around\nringing people’s doorbells at 4:00 in the morning.” Which was a reference\nto Freddy Eberstadt ringing Mick’s doorbell at that hour looking for Nenna.\nAs I looked around at how young the girls were, all I could think about\nwas the Interviews upstairs and about Rauschenberg getting arrested in\nTexas and about Roman Polanski, how the poor guy could make a mistake\nbecause these young girls could be as young or as old as they wanted to\nlook.\nTina Radziwill was there at Brearley, too. She’s changed a lot since that\nsummer Lee rented Montauk. She has so many pimples now. I mean, you’d\nthink they would have found a way to cure pimples. If a girl like Tina who\ncan spend all the money in the world to get rid of pimples can’t get rid of\nthem, then there’s no hope for me.\nNenna introduced us to another one of her girlfriends and she looked\nforty! She had tits so big and an ass so big. She was white, but there were a\ncouple of coloreds around the school, too. Then they gave us a terrible tour\nof the library and the gym and where the twelve-year-olds eat. All I could\nthink of was the magazines with maybe nude photos in them. I had Bob run\nupstairs to take them back, but they were gone. I told Nenna she just had to\ntell the headmistress that we’d just left them there meaning to pick them up\non the way out and she said she’d try to fix it. Cabbed back to the office\n($5).\nMick arrived twenty minutes late in a really good mood—I was\nphotographing the Stones. Then everybody started arriving—Ron Wood and\nEarl McGrath and Keith Richards who I think is just the most adorable\nperson, I love him. I told him I was the first person to meet his wife, Anita\nPallenberg. In the sixties.\nRichard Weisman was sending down tickets to a party for Ali, if Ali won\nhis fight with Shavers.\nSuzie Frankfurt called. She’s been seeing Sam Green all the time and I\nsaid to her, “Do you think that Sam Green doesn’t talk about you?” She\nsaid, “No, Sam loves me.” I said, “You mean you think he doesn’t go all\nover town repeating to everybody what you say?” She said, “But he doesn’t\ntalk about you.’1 I said “Yes, and that is because I never never tell him\nanything.”\nDropped off Catherine and Peter Marino. Peter and Catherine got\nfriendly in Montauk. I can’t figure Peter out, he’s nutty. I told him how he\nowed his whole life and architecture career to us—how we gave him his\nfirst job—took him out of his business knickers and gave him his long pants\nand he said that well now he was in Armani suits and that we sure didn’t put\nhim in those. He was funny (cab $4).\nChanged at home. Ate some of Archie’s food then started walking up to\n730 Park Avenue to a dinner for a Swiss guy who’s in town, who said he’s\nbeen dying to meet me. After dinner I went down to 66th Street to wait for\nmy date, Kevin Goodspeed, who I’d met at Studio 54. He’s big and he’s like\nmy old crush from the sixties, Rodney La Rod, and at first I thought he’d be\na good bodyguard until later in the evening when somebody stepped on his\ncamera and beat him up.\nCabbed to the party for Muhammad Ali at the Americana ($2.50). It was\none of those parties where you’re Waiting for Nothing. Ali never came, they\nsaid he was too badly hurt in the fight. But one great thing happened. I met\na black lady boxer. She invited me to go see her box.\nThen Richard Weisman wanted to go dancing so we went over to Studio\n54. Walked. Stevie Ru-bell is madly in love with me. And Victor was there\nand got jealous of my date Kevin. Victor was wearing “punk pants” and\nthey had a normal fly that was zipped and everything but at the bottom of\nthe zipper was a hole for his cock to hang through, and you didn’t even\nnotice it at first, everything looked like it was in order. He was also wearing\na sequined Halston bandanna like the kind he gave me. Then Kevin and I\nwent down to Kevin’s neighborhood on Third Avenue in the 30s to Sarge’s,\nthe all-night coffee shop, and after we had coffee I left him with some\npeople he knew there. It’s supposed to be the best coffee shop (breakfast\n$10). When I got out on the street a kid in a Mercedes pulled up and said he\nused to live on my block on 66th Street. I made him describe the street and\nhe did know it so I got into the car and he dropped me off. By then it was 5\nA.M."

What if there was a naked picture in that\nissue? I’m afraid to look. They only arrest the publisher. I’m the publisher,\nFred’s the president. Oh God. I don’t want to think about it. What was Larry\nFlynt when they arrested him? The publisher? Why don’t they arrest the\npresident—or the editor? Bob could just write his “Out” column from jail.\nIt would be a new scene for him to cover.\nAnd speaking of scenes, Steve Aronson read PH’s first draft of Popism\nand said he will edit it for us, after all—that it needs work but that it’s\nfascinating because it’s a scene that hasn’t been shown yet.\nPaul Jenkins came to the office. He’s a painter who puts paint on canvas\nand lets it roll, and his work is like somebody else’s but he does it well. I\nthink he’s interested in a portrait. He’s with the rich du Pont girl, Joanne."

      "text": "Went to the bus at Rockefeller Center to go out to see the Cosmos soccer\nteam play (cab $3). The bus was loading with Nan Kempner and Jerry\nZipkin and related types. The White House people, Tom Beard and Joel\nMcCleary, were getting into a limo and invited me into that. The Carter son\nwho isn’t married was supposed to be coming, that’s why the limo, but he\ndidn’t come.\nIn about forty-five minutes we were out in Jersey at the stadium club.\nWe got the VIP treatment, up to have brunch and bloody marys. Robert\nRedford and Muhammad Ali were there. Also Gordon Lightfoot and Albert\nGrossman, who used to manage Dylan. He told me again that he has my\nsilver Elvis, but I don’t understand that, because I gave it to Dylan, so how\nwould Grossman get it?\nKissinger was there waving his hands around like the pope. There were\nlots of Secret Service around. Then at 1:30 they made them go out to the\ngame.\nI went over to Muhammad Ali and said hi, but he looked at me blankly,\nhe didn’t seem to know who I was or remember that he met me down at his\ntraining camp in Pennsylvania. His people who tell him who’s who and\nwhat’s what weren’t around and he was just alone, eating, so I got\nembarrassed and backed away.\nIn the stands I sat next to Robert Redford’s two kids, about twelve and\nthirteen. Everybody said this was the first time Redford was out in public\nletting himself be photographed. There were empty seats all around me\nwhere the Carter kid was supposed to be but he never showed. Muhammad\nAli was in front of me and they’d put the Carter kid next to him. Ali’s wife\nand kid were there, too. Elaine of Elaine’s was there, too, she told me she\nwas on a high-protein diet. But later I saw her stuffing herself with rolls.\nPelé played on one side and then on the other side. When it started to\nrain, they passed out raincoats to the VIPs and it was nice in the rain, it\nmade it more exciting. Seventy-five thousand people there. The parks\ncommissioner invited Ali into his glass box so he wouldn’t get wet. When\nwe were getting really soaked we jumped into somebody’s box and the little\ngirl in it said her father owned the Giants.\nKissinger shook my hand, but he shook everybody’s. The men from\nAli’s Pennsylvania camp recognized me and asked if I’d talked to Ali and I\nlied and said no."

      "text": "Went to see Dr. Poster about my red eye and he said it was just a broken\nblood vessel, to put hot compresses on it. But I forgot to.\nCatherine and I went over to Gleason’s Gym to interview the girl boxer,\nJackie Tonawanda (cab $2.60). Lots of good-looking fighters went by. I\nasked about how you can own a fighter and Jackie said it would cost mostly\nto pay her, because she would manage them, and that would be $150 a\nweek, and then some more to rent a locker at Gleason’s. Catherine fell in\nlove with a 6’ 5” black fighter who was jumping rope. I tried to get her\ninterested in a cute Irish kid but she said he was too ordinary-looking.\nJackie wasn’t too good an interview because I’d mentioned something\nabout a movie and that was all she would keep bringing up. She’s ready to\ngo to Japan and fight a 6’3” Japanese-Irish girl.\nThen we cabbed up to the William Morris Agency ($3). We went up to\nthe thirty-third floor. A guy there, Steve Pincus, had been calling the office a\nlot wanting me to come over and talk to them about representing me. The\nmeeting was fun, he had other guys in there and they were telling me they’d\nget me American Express TV commercials and Broadway shows and\nstarring roles in movies, and Catherine got so impressed, and God it was so\nboring, you’d think I hadn’t heard all this for years, going up to William\nMorris and then after the Big Meeting, nothing happens. But I enjoyed\ngoing there. They were all married but they looked like closet queens.\nCatherine told me not to call her a “rich bitch” because it was undignified.\nSo now I finally know what to call her.\nAt dinner at Peter Luger’s Steakhouse I told Diane de Beauvau who was\nwith her boyfriend Pierre that when I was leaving the house it was on the\nradio or the TV that a five-year-old Patino girl had been kidnapped. Diane\nburst out crying hysterically and everybody turned on me and said I’d\nspoiled the party. Stevie went to the phone and called the wire services to\nget the story, and it was only a distant relative. But Diane was still\nhysterical, and they were saying, “To cry is a good thing, it brings out\nfeeling,” and in the middle of all this the cute Irish waiter came over and\ntold me that he had an Art Deco radio in his room—that he knew I collected\nthem.\nTimothy Leary told about how in the early seventies Diane had chased\nhim around Switzerland and sent him notes and letters and he said that it\nwas actually Diane carrying on like that that got him locked up. He told me\nI was one of his most favorite people of always. Bob Weiner was there, still\nresearching his article on Steve, and I’m sure it’s going to be so bad because\n1) it’s him writing it and 2) he didn’t pay any attention at dinner while all\nthese great things were happening and with all these great people together\n—he said it was “boring.” And every time Stevie would pick up a boy Bob\nwould turn the other way. And then Stevie started rushing everybody—\nthat’s all he likes to do is rush to get someplace and then rush to leave. But\nTim told him that for years—in prison—he’d been rushed and told what to\ndo, and he wasn’t going to rush anymore.\nThen we went to Elaine’s. Stevie was too zonked to drive, so Diane’s\nboyfriend, Pierre, drove. First we had to stop at Stevie’s house and he went\nin to get more Quaaludes or poppers or something, I think. Margaux\nHemingway was with us. Her marriage to the Wetson hamburger guy is\nsplitting up and Tim was after her, I guess. Then Stevie wanted to go to the\nBarefoot Boy and the Gilded Grape."

I had to start lying\nimmediately and tell her it was all great, but especially after seeing all those\nbeautiful Madame Grès and all the Halstons, her stuff just looked so bad.\nShe acts like a businesswoman—she doesn’t take much coke in the day—\nbut I don’t know, I think it’s going to be a disaster.\nAt dinner later at Quo Vadis, Tim Leary was really sweet, he talked\nsome more for the tape about how Diane writing him those love letters and\ntaking acid when she was fourteen got him in jail in Switzerland. He said\nthe jails in Geneva can be like a good hotel—if you pay them they bring\nyou pastries on a tray. And I can’t believe it, he remembers each time he\never saw me in the sixties and then in St. Moritz—what I was wearing,\neverything—and I didn’t even know at the time that he would be noticing.\nLike when we went to his lecture and light-show things in the East Village.\nHe said that if he had it to do all over again he wished he were with the\nVelvet Underground because they did so much and were really creative.\nI just think he’s so intelligent. He probably really was with the CIA,\nbecause he was the one at Harvard, and now they’re showing that the\ngovernment was using LSD so far back, and Tim was the master, and when\nyou’re a master they do approach you.\nDiane de Beauvau and Pierre were on a couch arguing. She wanted him\nto think she was in love with Tim Leary and that they’d had a romance, so\nto do that she made a point of telling Pierre that there was absolutely\nnothing going on, that she wasn’t in love with Tim. So then he had to do the\nthing of caring because that was how she would be happy."

Steve Aronson was at 860 looking around, he\nhad a beautiful girl with him. He says he can’t start editing Popism until\nnext week. Vincent was off in Montauk, checking on the place—Jay\nJohnson and Tom Cashin are still out there roofing and repairing. By\nclosing time Vincent still wasn’t back, so I locked the place up myself.

The\nphotographers were there and wanted Elton John and me to pose for\npictures together so I asked Elton if I could kiss him, but he didn’t answer\nme so I didn’t. Maybe he didn’t hear me. He was wearing a hat because of\nhis hair transplant.\nIn order to get out of Studio 54 alone, I had to avoid all the boys I’ve\nbeen accepting rides and dates from lately. I had to look nervous and run\naround so no one would follow me—you know, the “frantic” technique."

I asked Jed if\nhe wanted to come but he said he was too tired (cab $2). Big mansion. The\ndinner was a horror. They put us at such a nothing, nobody table. You can’t\nimagine—I was sitting next to Fred!\nSo here we were in this room where we didn’t even recognize anybody\nexcept each other and this girl comes over to me and says, “I know you\nhave a camera, and you can take pictures of everyone here except Mrs.\nOnassis.” I didn’t think too much of it right then, I just thought she was one\nof those nervous-type girls who run these events. And then that rich old guy\nNate Cummings was screaming at Fred to open a window, and at first Fred\nwas offended—Nate Cummings somehow picked him to scream at—but\nthen Fred figured out he was turning senile, so he decided to be a nice boy\nand do it, and then the girl started screaming at Fred not to. And Fred’s\ngoing to call her up and really tell her off, because things got much worse.\nWe got up and left that room and Fred went to find Diana Vreeland and\nwhen we walked into the other room, there was everybody we knew! Peter\nBeard was having fun with Barbara Allen and Lacey Neuhaus. I mean,\nCatherine was sitting at Jackie’s table! But that’s not the most incredible\nthing. When we walked into this room there were 4,000 photographers\ntaking pictures of Jackie. And that horrible girl had come over to tell me\nIcouldn’t! Fred’s really going to scream at her. It was like a Bobby Zarem\nevent, there were so many cameras flashing.\nI cabbed with Fred and Diana Vreeland to Sutton Place to Robin West’s\nparty for Jamie Wyeth. I didn’t have any change so I gave Fred $5. He gave\nthe money to the guy, the fare was $2.80, and he told him to keep $.60 and\nthe guy said, “How much is that?” and Fred started screaming, “I can’t do\nyour adding for you.” And all the way down in the cab Diana and Fred had\nbeen fighting like they were a screaming old married couple. And the cab\ndriver was butting into the conversation with, “Wasn’t that Peter Beard’s\nopening I picked you up outside of? Wasn’t he on the cover of the Sunday\nTimes?”\nI talked to Carole Coleman from New Orleans. She’s Jimmy Coleman’s\nsister. Then Bo Polk came into the room and it got crazy. He’d met Carole\nat a bar and they’d gone out, and now he said things like “I want to eat your\npussy,” and on and on like that, they were just talking in front of me and\nCarole wasn’t even embarrassed. I was surprised because she’s older than\nmost of the girls Bo Polk goes after. She has beautiful eyes and she’s rich\nand never married, she could have been like Jennifer O’Neill, but she has\nproblems, I guess, and not too many boyfriends, but very attractive. And he\nwas saying things like “I want to lick your toes and up to and into your\ncunt,” and then he’d turn to me and say, “I want you to be there and take\npictures, Andy,” and oh, he’s just nuts.\nI went to say hello to Phyllis Wyeth and then Bo Polk and John Larsen\ncame over and Bo yelled to some girl that he’d put some coke on her clit\nand John laughed and called him a coke tease. And then Bo and Carole left.\nBut then in a few minutes they came back in and talked about if they should\nleave and she wanted to know what they were going to do and that went on\nand on.\nAnd then Carole and Bo and Jay Mellon and Catherine and I left and\nwalked. We passed a place that had Famous Amos cookies in the window. I\nhad never seen the package. It was the most beautiful picture of a cookie\nthat I’ve ever seen, and I went in and bought it, but when I opened the\npackage, the cookies were really little. It was the first time I was ever\ndeceived! They tasted good, but they weren’t big and beautiful like the one\non the package."

I got flustered and then told the kid that he was so good-looking,\nwhy was he a cab driver. He said, “Well, the closest I ever came to acting\nwas I bought Joe Dallesandro’s dog.” He meant Caesar, Joe’s big dog that\nwas in Trash, that Paul brought back from Hollywood out of Jack La\nLanne’s dog’s litter. What he actually said was, “My girl and I bought his\ndog.” The kid had a high voice so I had high hopes he was a fairy until he\nsaid that. He said that he’s still with the girl and they still have the dog. I\nwas embarrassed about Iran so I gave him $5.\nCabbed to the bank ($3) then walked to the office. Then Rupert came by\nand he’d had a facial all morning from the famous health lady—he’s more\ninterested in having his hair dyed and facials than in working. And if you’re\ngoing to go for facials you have to go every day, and anyway, you might as\nwell do it yourself, all a “facial” means is that you take more than five\nminutes to wash your face. Jay and Tom stopped by for a while, they were\nmourning Michelle Long, their drag queen friend who just died.\nWent to Regine’s dinner for Ira Von Furstenberg (cab $2). Regine never\nshowed up. Talked to Ira. And then her son came in and he was so good-\nlooking. We did his brother for Interview recently, Kiko Hohenlohe, but this\none was even better-looking. Ira said, “I could be the best stage mother in\nthe world.” But his father wants him not to be an actor. Princess Ira has\nalways wanted to be a movie star. Always. She’s been in lots of movies that\nnever made it. I saw on TV the other night the Darryl Zanuck movie that he\nmade for his girlfriend, Genevieve Gilles, and Ira was the second lead.\nFrançois Catroux was there with his wife Betty, and they were sitting\nwith Ahmet Ertegun. And in a case like that who do you say hello to first—\nyou go to the table and who do you kiss first? I know Ahmet was offended.\nPrincess Ashraf was there with her boyfriend who likes polo.\nCatherine was talking to a beautiful woman and it turned out to be\nPrincess Elisabeth of Yugoslavia who seemed to know me, and she asked\nwhy I wasn’t at Sharon Hammond’s cocktail party the day before. She’s\ntrying to get a green card and so is Ira, everybody wants a green card. And\nan interesting thing is that how she knows Sharon is that Mr. Oxenberg,\nPrincess Elisabeth’s first husband, left her for Maureen McCluskey,\nSharon’s sister, and I can’t figure that out.\nBut anyway, Ira’s son was so handsome, he had the slight kind of accent,\njust the right kind, like a kid that you would want to go out on a date with."

Vincent and I went out in the\nvestibule and heard a little voice calling for help. The fifth floor had called\nthe Tenth Precinct, but they should have called the Thirteenth. The Tenth\nwas over on the West Side. When the police arrived the first two were\nemergency-unit types, with ski jackets and baseball hats, like SWAT-\nlooking. Then two uniformed cops came.\nThey were doing everything by the emergency regulation rulebook. But\none kidded and said, “Do you have any dynamite?” in a loud voice. One\nwas peeking down into the shaft and the other was holding onto his\ncoattails. Finally from the third floor they lowered a rope ladder down to\nthe car and brought Victor up through the hole in the top.\nThen afterwards they washed up in the bathroom and one took off his\nbelt and holster, and it was lying on the table, the gun in the holster, while\nhe washed up.

When I was in India I could’ve gotten anything for nothing,\nbut it’s one of those things I just don’t understand. Like Chinese stuff—I\ncan’t tell which is the good stuff, it all looks like the same junk.

Robert Hayes and Marc Balet came in to work on\nInterview.\nI called Bianca and she said to come right over to Halston’s, so we did\nand Dr. Giller the cute doctor was already there. We cabbed to Saturday\nNight Fever ($3) and when we got there it was all sold out. So then we\ncabbed to the other theater where it was playing and that was sold out, too\n(cab $3). Then we decided to try to see the Buñuel film, That Obscure\nObject of Desire (tickets $14, popcorn $4). It was really good, more modern\nthan his early ones because every once in a while when it would get quiet,\nthey would look out the window through the venetian blinds at the Paris\nstreet, and a bomb would go off—somebody would be blowing something\nup. But none of us could understand the movie. It’s one role played by two\ngirls, and they never explain why.\nLarry Rivers and his girlfriend came in and they sat near us. Larry told\nme that he did Aly Kaiser’s portrait, and she’s the one that said she wanted\nme to do her portrait and Victor kept telling me to call her and I just didn’t.\nSo Larry did her portrait, and I think he must have had to fuck her, I don’t\nknow.\nSo we walked back to Halston’s, and he’d fixed those pastas with meat\ninside them, not ravioli but maybe they’re called cannellonis? And he’d\nmade a chicken, and we had lots of drinks. And Stevie Rubell was there,\nand Bianca got upset because he reads the London papers and he quoted\nsomething Mick had said. It was in Earl Wilson’s column here today about\nhim and Jerry Hall, so it probably was Stevie who gave it to him—I mean,\nhe pretends to be so friendly, and then he calls up the papers. And there\nwere so many English reporters outside Halston’s waiting for a statement\nfrom Bianca or Halston.\nBianca and Halston seem like they’re a couple now, they really do. It’s\nlike a romance. But Bianca is so upset about Mick, and I’m surprised that\nshe is, because she could get somebody rich in a minute. Somebody said to\nHalston, “Why don’t you marry Bianca?” and he put his hands on his hips\nand said, “Because I’m the hostess here.”\nAnd then we all went over to a place called the Ice Palace on 57th and\nSixth. It’s lesbians and hustlers. Bianca was dancing around, but she’s so\nunhappy, and she and Halston were trying to get Jed to go home with them,\nand they were asking me if this was okay. She said, “Nobody likes me.”\nEverybody was wet from drinks getting spilled on them."

We cabbed up to 86th Street\n($2.75) and we finally hit Saturday Night Fever at the right time and were\nable to get in. Well, the movie was just great. That bridge thing was the best\nscene—and the lines were great. It’s I guess the new kind of fantasy movie,\nyou’re supposed to stay where you are. The old movies were things like\nDead End and you had to get out of the dead end and make it to Park\nAvenue and now they’re telling you that it’s better off to stay where you are\nin Brooklyn—to avoid Park Avenue because it would just make you\nunhappy. It’s about people who would never even think about crossing the\nbridge, that’s the fantasy. And they played up Travolta’s big solo dance\nnumber, but then at the end they made the dance number with the girl so\nnothing, so underplayed. They were smart. And New York looked so\nexciting, didn’t it? The Brooklyn Bridge and New York. Stevie Rubell\nwants to do a disco movie, but I don’t think you could do another one, this\none was so great. But why didn’t they do it as a play first? What was this\nfirst, a short story? They should have milked it—done it as a play first and it\nwould have run forever.\nBianca fell asleep. Somewhere in the theater we found Dr. Giller. But he\nhad related to the movie so well that he wanted to see it again, so we left\nhim there and went back to Halston’s.\nHalston and Bianca were in the kitchen together cooking, and he said he\nhad so much energy he wanted to go dancing. He told me lots of gossip—he\nsaid that the night before when the doorbell rang it was Liza Minnelli. Her\nlife’s very complicated now. Like she was walking down the street with\nJack Haley her husband and they’d run into Martin Scorsese who she’s now\nhaving an affair with, and Marty confronted her that she was also having an\naffair with Baryshnikov and Marty said how could she. This is going on\nwith her husband, Jack Haley, standing there! And Halston said that it was\nall true, and he also said that Jack Haley wasn’t gay. You see? I was right, I\ndidn’t think so. Halston said Jack likes Liza but that what he really goes for\nis big curvy blonde women. So when the doorbell rang the night before, it\nwas Liza in a hat pulled down so nobody would recognize her, and she said\nto Halston, “Give me every drug you’ve got.” So he gave her a bottle of\ncoke, a few sticks of marijuana, a Valium, four Quaaludes, and they were all\nwrapped in a tiny box, and then a little figure in a white hat came up on the\nstoop and kissed Halston, and it was Marty Scorsese, he’d been hiding\naround the corner, and then he and Liza went off to have their affair on all\nthe drugs.\nThen Dr. Giller arrived from his second viewing of Saturday Night\nFever. Bianca had been fighting with Victor before he came, because Victor\nwas eating all the hamburgers she’d made and she was saying to save some\nfor Dr. Giller. But I think she just wanted them herself—her ass has gotten\nreally big.\nThe Sex Pistols arrived in the U.S. today. Punk is going to be so big.\nThey’re so smart, whoever’s running their tour, because they’re starting in\nPittsburgh where the kids have nothing to do, so they’ll go really crazy.\nAnd Bianca loves Jed. She keeps calling the house, but he was off in\nConnecticut with Judith Hollander and Sandy Brant for his interior\ndecorating business.\nAnd they wanted to go out, but Halston didn’t like the way Bianca\nlooked, so he put three feathers in her hair. Oh, and Victor had just come\nover to get an extra bottle of Vaseline from upstairs."

And while Halston was telling me this, Bianca came in from\nexercise class and Halston had her show her muscles, so she dropped her\ntop and showed them, and she really does have a good body on top. Then\nshe made another Puerto Rican dinner.\nAnd then Dr. Giller came in and he’d slept a few hours after being up all\nnight dancing, so he was refreshed, and he started trying to find Halston’s\nenergy center, and while he did that, Halston was having white powder, so\nfinally when Dr. Giller announced that he’d found Halston’s energy center\nHalston had had enough white powder so that he did have energy.

He didn’t put any feathers in her hair this\ntime.

Zahedi, then the—empress, the queen.\nThen Koch, then Carey, then Kissinger—and he talked for almost forty-five\nminutes, so long-winded. They flew in violets for the ladies, and the caviar\nwas called Pearls of the Caspian Sea and Paulette had about a pound. It was\nwhite and not too salty. The violinist from Lester Lanin asked for Paulette’s\nautograph. Paulette wanted to leave so we did and she said she’d go out of\nher way to drop me at the door, it was so cold. I mean, you know it’s cold\nwhen Paulette gets considerate."

      "text": "Interviewed Lucie Arnaz at Quo Vadis, and it was nothing really startling.\nShe’s so tall, she eats everything, she’s a little fat and she was wearing jeans\nso she looked fatter, but she has a beautiful face. We brought up Jim Bailey\nthe female impersonator and Burt Reynolds. She dated both of them. She\nsaid Burt was sweet and devoted. These girls are brought up strict, they\nthink you shouldn’t put out.\nWent uptown ($6) to pick Catherine up at 7:50 and walked over to the\nCopa for the Bette Midler opening that Mica Ertegun sent tickets for. Ron\nGalella was there and he had his own camera crew—a TV thing was being\ndone on him. It was the same Mafia-type people at the Copa like when we\nhad our party there last year. Richard Turley was standing in the doorway\nand he asked if he could try to slip in with me, and I didn’t know what to\nsay, I said he could do whatever he wanted to but that it was Mafia and that\nhe’d never make it, and he didn’t. Chessy Rayner was there, and Peter Tufo\nand Lee Radziwill were there together but she was at a different table from\nhim, and I’ll get to that in a second.\nI couldn’t see anything, just the top two inches of Bette’s head when she\nfinally came out. And Catherine was sitting so that she faced Peter Tufo and\npretty soon I felt his leg rubbing against mine and I guess he thought it was\nCatherine. They were really flirting hot and heavy, and he said to her, “Why\ndon’t you get up on the table and boogie?” and I was surprised because he’s\nusually so sour. He was yelling things like (laughs) “Colored sounds!” at\nthe black girls singing.\nI kept hitting Catherine to turn around and look at the show, but she was\ntelling about going to Plato’s Retreat the night before. She said she didn’t\nknow if she’d been penetrated or not while she was there, and hearing this\ngot Peter Tufo hotter, and she spilled a drink on his pants, but that just made\nhim hotter, too, and he slipped her a note that I found out later said just\n“When?” and all I could think was that it was a repeat of our friend Barbara\nAllen taking Peter Beard away from Lee, and now here our friend Catherine\nwas stealing Peter Tufo.\nI just wanted to run out, it’s a firetrap there, I hate to be in places like\nthat. And then everybody left, Catherine went back inside to get the\n“When?” note and we got separated, and she went over to Quo Vadis in the\nErteguns’ limo, and I walked over and when I was walking in Lee and Peter\nTufo were fighting, but Lee stopped fighting to wish me Happy New Year\nwith a kiss. We were at Ahmet’s table. Dinner was a little pigeon. Lee left\nfirst and I thought Peter Tufo would stay for Catherine, but he left with Lee,\nso Catherine was safe. And Ahmet was loading up with cognac and being\nfunny. And afterwards we were all invited up to the Cotton Club, which\nthey were reopening with Cab Calloway in Harlem, and Catherine and Mica\nand Ahmet wanted to go, but I don’t think anybody else really did. I walked\nCatherine home, and it was early.\nAlso today, got back my photographs of Edwige cutting her wrists at\nVictor’s party the other night, and Victor said that her scars would be punk\njewelry.\nAnd Bob met today with the Rums of Puerto Rico guy from Kenyon &\nEckhardt and the guy who’s from something like the Puerto Rican Chamber\nof Commerce, and they want to have a party at the office to unveil the Liza\nportrait I’m doing because Liza’s endorsing Rums of Puerto Rico, and so\nthey’re giving Interview three months of rum ads. They’re trying to get Burt\nReynolds for this campaign, and I’d be doing his portrait, too, but the two\npeople he wants to be in the ad with him, the agency didn’t think they were\n“cosmetically right.” So Bob called Burt’s manager in L.A. and had to ask\nif they could submit some other possibilities, and the manager said, “Listen,\nBurt’s endorsement is worth a million dollars and he’s only even\nconsidering it because he wants a Warhol portrait, and if Burt sent a midget\nand a dwarf over to be in the ad with him, Rums of Puerto Rico and their ad\nagency should be thrilled.” And Bob said the people Burt wants aren’t even\nbad-looking anyway."

And Cal, the friend of Robert Hayes’s who was at\nBonwit’s and gave us ads there, is now at Bloomingdale’s. Bob gave a big\nimpressive speech about Interview, and then he turned to Carole Rogers,\nInterview’s associate publisher, and said, “Carole, could you give us some\nstatistics, please?” waiting for her to reinforce the figures that he’d given—\nthat Interview’s circulation is 80,000 and that 20 percent of that is\nsubscriptions—but instead she said, “Our subscriptions are 7,000,” and\neveryone turned red and gasped, and Bob couldn’t believe it. Afterwards\nCal called and said that was the first thing Mr. Traub brought up in the car\nafter they left, so that might have blown it, but they’ll give Interview\nsomething because they do think it reaches the right people. All the\nBloomingdale’s people were in blue suits."

Barbara\nwas just back from Acapulco, and she was very tanned. When she heard the\nnews about Mick Flick and Andrea, she tried not to look shocked—she\nrecovered in a second and said, “I only had one date with him and he was so\nboring that I left before the espresso.”\nAt around 4:00 Margaret Trudeau arrived, and Marc Balet and Robert\nHayes took her to be photographed. Arranged to meet her at 9:00 at Quo\nVadis. Worked until around 8:00, then dropped off Catherine (cab $4).\nWent home, glued, and then walked over to Quo Vadis to meet Bob and\nMargaret Trudeau. She did a really great interview. She had five margaritas.\nHer family sounds like Viva’s, she has a lot of sisters, too, but then she’s\nmore intelligent and more beautiful than Viva and her family, because she’s\nnot so crazy. She hitchhiked in 1969 in Morocco. And she had us turn off\nthe tape and she told us that she sat next to Nixon at dinner and he didn’t\ntalk to her the whole time until he turned around and told her about the sex\nlife of a panda, and that was it.\nMargaret was wearing a new designer’s dress. She said she was just on\nthe list of the worst-dressed women in the world. She told us that wherever\nshe goes, no matter who else is around, the photographers always go after\nher and keep snapping. Then we went over to Studio 54 for Scavullo’s\nbirthday party and it was true (cab $3.25). Margaret was dancing and the\ncameramen went crazy. Stevie had said there would only be one\nphotographer, but there were twenty to fifty. When they brought in the\nbirthday cake, which was in the shape of a camera for Scavullo, they didn’t\neven notice the cake—they were still going after Margaret."

Saw PH there\nbidding on a huge pink necklace and when it went over her limit she\ndropped out, but then I bid some more and got it and gave it to her. She was\nso grateful she took me down to the Village to Sixth Avenue near Waverly\nand showed me a secret store she’d discovered on the second floor where a\nman sells all the Diors and Balenciagas that belonged to his sister who’s\nnow dead. It was the greatest place and I bought about five dresses.\nEverything there is size 14, though, because the sister was fat. The store is\ncalled Fabulous Fashions, and it has hats and handbags and umbrellas, too,\nand it’s all cheap.\nI went home to change for dinner, but I forgot that Sandra Payson—you\nknow, Lady Weidenfeld—had told me it was black tie. So I glued myself\nand went over there. Cabbed to Sutton Place ($2.25). It was a small dinner\nparty and when I saw I was the only one not in black tie, that’s when I\nremembered that she had mentioned it. When they saw how bad I looked\neverybody ran away from me and they didn’t come back until they were\ndrunk. I was trying to make it better with conversation, so I just started\ntelling them about how I was buying lots of dresses now, and they just\nbacked away. And Mrs. Payson invited me, I think, because she wanted a\npainting, but she never mentioned a thing about it so I guess she was so\nshocked by my clothes that she decided against it.\nThe party was for a ballerina whose name I forget, but who was the big\nballerina at the same time Margot Fonteyn was—not a Russian, though. She\ntold me about every cat she’d ever had and how each one died. She had a\nSiamese who jumped onto a ledge and then fell five stories, and she said\nshe could still see the claw marks that it left on the ledge, and that was sad\n—it tried to turn around and it slipped."

(laughs) Can you believe how long it takes to get\nthe real story? So then everyone at the table thought we hated Bill Graham\nand didn’t talk to him—Bobby Zarem was there, too, with us, and he’s\ngetting fatter and fatter—but it wasn’t that we were mad, I was just dead\ntired. But they thought there was “tension at the table.” Dropped Catherine\nat the Westbury ($3)."

The whole idea of the\ndinner was to interview Joel McCleary, but then my tape recorder was\ndoing funny things. I sat next to a girl, Lynn, who said she and Joel were\nfirst sweethearts but that they never got married because he was a hippie\nand she was a Marxist. It was fascinating to see two hippies who couldn’t\nmake it because they were different kinds of hippies. She said that Joel used\nto be so skinny, but now he’s gotten fat, but that fat was better for politics,\nthat it was better to see a big hunk of man up there. She said her guru told\nher that if you’re a man and you’re thin, then you turn homosexual, and I’m\nthinking I agree with that because of all the models. She said she and Joel\nmeet once a year and tell each other off. So I guess people do do that. I told\nher that was what the couple does in that Broadway play Same Time Next\nYear.\nLynn said she’s involved with that Pillsbury guy’s foundation, but when\nI asked her for money she said she’s only able to give it (laughs) to “people\nin New England.”"

Mr. and Mrs. Ghaferi.\nBallato’s was very exciting because John and Yoko Lennon and Peter\nBoyle and his new I think wife were there. Catherine asked John for his\nautograph and he said no, because he said he just read that Robert Redford\ndoesn’t give autographs, so he wouldn’t either.

The food was really good and Mr. Ballato was there, and I paid\nthe check with a check and then it was so early, 10:30, but they dropped us\nhome.\nOh, and in the middle of dinner I told Catherine how Brigid and Chris\nHemphill were both refusing to transcribe any more of the interviews that\nshe does because they said they were so bad, and I told Bob he’d have to\nstraighten it out. And later he told me he doesn’t know what to do, because\non the one hand Catherine’s interviews are really bad—I mean, she asked\nwhere the Bronx was in one of her interviews, and then even left it in the\narticle because she thought that was “fascinating”—but on the other hand\nBrigid and Chris shouldn’t be allowed to decide what they’ll transcribe.\nAnd at dinner the Iranians told me that when I paint the Shah to go easy\non the eye shadow and lipstick.

And then he told\nme that she’d mistaken him for Bob Colacello, and when he got insulted\nshe was telling him how attractive Bob Colacello was and I blew it.\nBarbara is really unhappy—Bianca’s got herself a movie career and\nManuela has Philip. She had a good long talk at Diane’s with Philip. And\nManuela isn’t good-looking at all.\nBarbara said the same thing that Bianca did, that Mick Flick was after\nher."

We were\ntalking about plane crashes and Tom was telling about his—the one that\nwrecked his hand that he wears the glove on, and Consuelo said, “If you\ncrashed in an airplane, you were probably in Colombia, right?” And he was.\nTom doesn’t seem to take coke too much but I think he was missing\nMargaret so he was snorting some.

Margaret was just sitting at the\nbar, and if any photographer had come in he would have gotten great\npictures, but they weren’t there.\nStudio 54 is making Regine desperate.\nMargaret told me how much she loved Tom. And she said that she didn’t\nlike Tony Portago, she didn’t like his line. And then she told me Tom’s line\nand it sounded exactly the same. Tom’s lines were: “I want to thank Pierre\nTrudeau for making you such a fascinating woman,” and “Good night, Mrs.\nTrudeau.” And Tony, she said, had said, “Margaret Trudeau, can I dance\nwith you?” And that one she didn’t like. So (laughs) I don’t know. And she\nsaid that when she was up in Canada this weekend the prime minister,\nwho’s still her husband, said that her interview in Interview was the best\nshe’s ever done."

Andrew Stein was\nat the next table with his girlfriend. Catherine ordered Guinness and\nchampagne—a black velvet. Ossie Clark came by. Tom Sullivan arrived just\nup from Florida where he’d gone with Margaret Trudeau. She was outside\nin the limo.\nWhen we got to Studio 54, I thought it was just going to be about fifteen\nor twenty people for Liz Taylor’s party, but it was more like 2,000, so if\nHalston was paying, it cost a fortune. It was a good work night for me,\nbecause I saw Mrs. Kaiser—Aly—and she said her face would be okay next\nweek to have her picture taken, and we talked about the Joan Crawford sale.\nLiz looked like a—bellybutton. Like a fat little Kewpie doll. John\nWarner said hello to me. Rod Gilbert was with the cutest new hockey\nplayer, a blond, who Catherine fell in love with the other night, and she says\nshe’s going to try to get him but she doesn’t think she’s going to be able to,\nbut she’s going to try. He was with a girl with big tits. And Margaret and\nTom didn’t get much fanfare from the photographers, I guess they’re an old\ncouple by now. And Bianca paid no attention to me at all, but then she\nwanted me to dance with her so that it would be the new kind of picture for\nthe photographers. She was wearing black and white, that’s the current\nHalston thing, but she just really doesn’t look good in his clothes. And\nBianca kept telling me to call Chris Wilding over, and then when he came,\nshe would act like she hadn’t had a thing to do with it, so he’d look at me\nand say, “Yes?”—like “What did you want?”—and I didn’t have a thing to\nsay, and Bianca would act disinterested, and it was just so dumb.\nTruman Capote was there and he and Bob were dancing all night and the\nphotographers were taking pictures. Truman looks so thin. Diana Vreeland\nwas there, and people were being brought over to Liz—she was the queen. I\nmet a quarterback.\nBob was watching Bianca take poppers and he said to Diana Vreeland,\n“It really becomes more like pagan Rome every day,” and she said, “I\nshould hope so—isn’t that what we’re after?”\nThe decorations were fabulous, vases as big as people, filled with\nflowers, and they did a tribute to Liz with pictures on the wall.\nAnd Monique was there, and we reminisced about the time I met Liz for\nthe first time in Rome around the time we were there making Frankenstein\nand Dracula."

Like that night when we all went to her house\nand the two Negro kids were with us—Esther Phillips and the guy she was\nwith—she didn’t just have them because they were with us, I think she had\nus because we were with them.

The party wasn’t that great. It was missing\npeople. Muhammad Ali never showed up and Liz Taylor didn’t either. But\nCarol Channing popped around the corner with Eartha Kitt who she said\nwas dying to meet me, but then we didn’t have anything to say to each\nother. Melba Moore was there. It was a nice party, though, a live band. Jane\nHolzer and Bob Denison was there, and a couple of hustlers from Studio 54\nwho weren’t in black tie, they were in white jumpsuits. Liza was wearing a\ngold Halston, and she got upset when Dr. Giller pulled down on it because\nshe’d just been in the bathroom to fix it to stay up. It was a funny dress,\nopen from the crotch down to the floor in a V. And the Halston crowd has a\nnew accent, they’re now all talking in a tongue-tied lisp. It’s the new thing.\nAnd they all say [imitates] “pussycat.” I met David Mahoney who runs\nNorton Simon that bought Halston, and Martha Graham took me into a\ncorner and said she’d like to have tea with me. All the pretty girls were in\nHalstons.\nDiana Vreeland was there and Truman Capote with Bob MacBride. He’s\nthe person that was with Truman even back when I did the Rolling Stone\ninterview with him in 1973. He looks even weirder than ever, there was\nalways something strange about him. But Truman told me that he couldn’t\ngo for the young ones, meaning that it had to be this type. Bob MacBride is\nstill taking notes—even when I first met him with Truman he was taking\nnotes, but I don’t know what for. He still has the wife and six kids. He’s lost\na lot of weight. Actually, he’s lost everything—he looks strange.\nAl Pacino was there and he looked handsome—we’ve heard through the\ngrapevine that he might be interested in renting Montauk, so we’ll see about\nthat. De Niro was there, he looked fat, and Scorsese was with them.\nKen Harrison the porno star was at my table. Bianca and Stevie brought\nout a big birthday cake and Liza started singing “New York, New York” but\nthen Sterling St. Jacques went over and joined her singing and (laughs) she\ngot upset and moved over to another microphone and sang some more. And\nthen I asked Marty Scorsese if he’d ever met Margaret Trudeau and he said\nno, and so I went and got her, I was pushing her as an actress. Marty told\nme Julia sends her love. I told him they should get back together and he\nsaid he couldn’t, that they were just friends now. He’s so short. God.\nHalston was kissing Liza and Bianca was lost somewhere with Federico De\nLaurentiis, and the photographers were photographing and it looked unreal,\nlike a big movie scene."

And Fred said what was wrong with\nHalston’s party was that it looked like the funny restaurant that you walk\ninto when you’re out of town in some city, and you find it on top of a\nbuilding—that’s what Halston’s office place looks like, all the mirrors. I\nspent most of the party out in the hallway because I couldn’t find Catherine.\nSomeday somebody is going to walk smack into a mirror there. The mirrors\nare what made the party seem so full.\nCabbed down to Chembank ($4) and then walked over to the office\nwhere Mr. and Mrs. Carimati were coming for lunch. Bob is staying longer\nat the office these days because Kevin’s out of the picture now, so I dropped\nhim and Catherine off (cab $3.50). Then Charlotte Ford called me and\ninvited me to a party for her book at some restaurant on 58th and Third, and\nthat sounded like work so I invited Bob. The party was at 7:00 but we didn’t\nget there until 8:00 (cab $2.50). Charlotte said that it wasn’t actually for her\nwhole book, just for the part of it that had just come out in the Ladies’\nHome Journal. And then a lady came over and said “I’m Mrs. Hershey, and\nI used to work at McCall’s, I remember you and your drawings.” And I\nasked her what she was doing now and she said, “Listen, I’m giving this\nparty, I’m the editor-in-chief of Ladies’ Home Journal.” The party was a lot\nof squares you never see around. It was black tie and Bob and I were in\nblack tie, but Tom Armstrong wasn’t, and I’m noticing that a lot of people\ndon’t come in black tie when it says to, so I’m giving that a lot of thought.\nI turned around and there was a beautiful beautiful lady near me, and it\nturned out to be Rocky Converse, and Bob was next to her husband. We had\na really really good time, I talked to her and Bob talked to her husband. She\nwas married to Gary Cooper and she’s the mother of Maria Cooper Janis.\nShe said she doesn’t believe in the mystic ESP stuff that her daughter does,\nthough. She said her husband’s had three heart attacks, but that he’s still the\nbest plastic surgeon in town, and that he was going to die with his boots on.\nShe said that Pat Buckley told her she should wear her hair pulled back and\nshe pulled it back and she looked beautiful. It was like looking at Joan\nCrawford."

I’d brought two copies of the Dali book so Dali could sign them and\nit turned out that one of them had already been signed “To Fred” so Dali re-\nsigned it to me. Dali is so full of ideas, and he’s ahead in some things, but\nthen he’s behind in others. It’s odd.

He said that my idea of piss-painting was\nold-fashioned because it’d been in the movie Teorema which (laughs) is\ntrue, it was. I knew that. And then he said something great—he said that the\npunks are the “Shit Children,” because they’re descendents of the beatniks\nand the hippies, and he’s right. Isn’t that great? The Shit Children. He is\nsmart. Dali told me that he was looking for “beautiful freaks” and I told him\n(laughs) I’d send him Walter Steding. Walter was performing on his “magic\nviolin” later that night at Max’s.

Afterwards a friend of Louis Malle’s came up and said that\nLouis really wanted to know what I thought and I said it was “wonderful,”\n“interesting,” “strange.” Then we had an exciting elevator ride down\nbecause it was Baryshnikov, Barbara, Milos Forman, Frank Yablans, Diane\nVon Furstenberg. And Milos was peeking under Baryshnikov’s jacket\n—“looking for the little girl.” And Baryshnikov has such a great body but\nhis hair is so funny. He wears it puffy, one of those bubble hairdos. He\nshould get a haircut that makes him look more masculine with his good\nRussian face."

He started at seventeen, whatever he does. He\ntold me about owning beachfront property in California. He said he had a\ncoffee business in Brazil, but I don’t know, it sounded like smuggling. I\nmean, a couple of good cocaine loads and you’ve made a few million. He\nlooks so young, and anything you mention, he’s “thinking of buying it.” He\nsaid he wanted to buy Radio City Music Hall and turn it into the world’s\nlargest discotheque. That would be such a great idea. New York needs the\nworld’s biggest discotheque.\nThen Tom Sullivan arrived and this Chris made Tom seem like peanuts.\nThen Gianni Agnelli came in and Chris said he was thinking of buying Fiat,\nso I went over to where Gianni was talking to Regine and Diana and said\nthat I had a buyer for Fiat and his ears perked up. The two of them went\nover into a corner, but then (laughs) Gianni left really fast.\nThen Tom Sullivan pissed on some paintings for me and left.\nDoc Cox was thrilled, talking to Regine and Diana and then meeting\nGianni Agnelli."

Why\ndon’t they make them in dark colors so they could be dress shoes, they’d be\nso comfortable. Jerry complained that the Pierre made a big point of calling\nher Miss Hall all the time, and finally she and Mick were deciding that they\nshould really go to a new place.

Gene Shalit thinks she’s hysterical.\nAnd then Averil Meyer came to the office because she wanted to meet\nRuth Carter Stapleton who was coming with Dotson Rader at 3:00 (cab $4).\nBut they didn’t get there until 4:00.\nBrigid was offended that Dotson said “fuck” and “shit” in front of Ruth,\nand she said, “There’s nothing left to respect in life if he can say that in\nfront of the president’s sister. It just shows you that Nixon should be back in\nthe White House.” And Ruth Carter Stapleton was sweet, and Dotson was\ndisgusting as usual. She wanted a Polaroid of us and naturally there weren’t\nany bulbs, so Ronnie went out to get some and Vincent took a Polarvision\nmovie and showed it and that was the entertainment. I gave her a Bad T-\nshirt.\nAnd the guy from the hamburger place came by. I’m doing a portrait of\na hamburger, Frank Fowler got me the job. I can’t remember the name. Not\nMcDonald’s, not Burger King, not Wendy’s, not Wetsons—something else.\nToni the girl I met from High Times magazine and her girlfriend Carole\nwere picking me up in a limo at 8:30. So I waited until 10:00 and finally\nthey arrived, then we picked up Brigid. I wanted to tape them and see if I\ncould make a play out of it. Toni was wearing a T-shirt of two guys making\nit.\nWell, we went down to 10th Street between First and Second to Princess\nPamela’s restaurant, something like that. Carole was in a fur coat. We rang\nthe doorbell and Princess Pamela answered, a colored lady in a bright red\nwig. She looked like a drag queen, so you get the idea. They’d expected us\nat 8:30. Well, we went up the stairs to the second floor and there was\nnobody else in the place but two Negro girls, waitresses—entertainers. It\nwas three little rooms and a white piano in one room. And the two girls\nwere about thirty-five and sort of intelligent, but like black Valerie\nSolanises. It was a restaurant with readings in between courses. The place\nstarted out fifteen years ago, and Craig Claiborne gave it a couple of stars in\n1966 when it was on the ground floor. And they had pictures of Norman\nNorell on the wall and he’s dead already of throat cancer, probably from\neating there. I thought I heard her say something about Idi Amin flying over\nfrom Paris once for a party at her place but I don’t know, that I may have\nheard wrong.\nToni and Carole—all they talk about is 1966. I kept asking them what\nhappened between ‘70 and ‘75, and they were off drugs, I guess, so they\nsaid, “Nothing.”\nThe princess put on a gown and was singing, and she brought in a 2’ X\n1’ peach cobbler made out of a canned peach and it was so sad because\nnobody had been there, it wasn’t even cut into. She said, “I made it just for\nyou.” And I didn’t want to eat it, so to make it look used, I put it on Brigid’s\nplate, and Brigid gave me one of her mean “Honey” looks, like her mother\nHoney gives her, and said how dare I. And the princess had a brochure\nabout the place that had something about Joe Franklin in it.\nBrigid was just in love with the place, you know how overboard she\ngoes. She’s going to start going there all the time. And then I couldn’t take\nit anymore, I just had to leave, so I went downstairs. Toni paid the bill."

She wrote Yogi Berra a note and passed it on toward him,\nbut someone didn’t pass it along and so she got up and went and took it\nback. He used to be with the Mets. The note said something like:\n“Remember when you bounced me on your knee, then gave me a hot dog in\nthe dugout?” And Mickey Mantle got his award—that’s what it was for.\nAnd Howard Cosell was introducing people from the dais and he introduced\nme, he called me a Pop artist—I guess Richard is pushing to get the\npaintings sold.\nI talked to Suzy Chapstick and she said that she’s noticed that most girls\nwho get famous are tomboys when they’re little, and I said that I’d been a\ntomboy.\nAnd then at the office there was the big problem with Halston. He called\nFred to say that Victor’s been going around saying that if Halston didn’t pay\nus the money he owes for the paintings he bought from us, that he, Victor,\nwould repossess them and sell them to Elsa Peretti. Halston asked Fred if\nwe’d put Victor up to it. Fred said no. And Halston’s fired everyone at the\nhouse —Lorenzo and the maid, too. All since last weekend. And he’s\nhaving trouble with his line, he can’t work, he’s been so upset. The other\nnight in the basement at 54 there was a huge fight that Elsa started—she\nwas attacking Stevie and calling everybody faggots and it was really bad, I\nguess. I wasn’t there. Bob finally got her to leave with him. It’s enough to\nmake you want to stay home for the rest of your life. She was smashing\nglasses and everything. So between Victor and Elsa, Halston’s really a\nwreck.\nThe other big event at the office in the afternoon was when Ronnie\nopened the door to the bathroom in the conference room—that lock doesn’t\nreally work—and there was Margaret Trudeau sitting on the toilet with her\npants down and a coke spoon up her nose.

Or it’s like investing in art, you trust people, or investing\nin stocks, you don’t know, so you accept what they say is good or bad, or\neven sports. Or terrorist groups, they’re out in the street handing you things\nand they’re in their own world.\nBut still, today, if somebody said, “We have to do this to the Puerto\nRicans,” I mean, could you do it? You couldn’t. So how did they do it? I\nmean, think of some German you actually know: could they do it, or … But\nif you do it once, you can do it again and again, that’s for sure.

Fred set that up.\nThen Stevie called and told me to ask Bob to invite Elsa Peretti, he said\nhe didn’t care about that fight in the basement, that he didn’t care that she\ncalled him a kike.\nSo I picked up Catherine and we went over to Halston’s. Then the\ndoorbell rang and Joe Eula came back and said that it was Barbara Allen—\nI’d told her about Halston’s party—and Halston got offended and said,\n“This was supposed to be a small party!” And then Barbara came in with\nGianni Agnelli and Baron and Baroness Von Thyssen, who I didn’t\nrecognize, but I guess they thought I was ignoring them because of the\npainting they sent back a few years ago. And Bianca and Dr. Giller had\ngone to the Erotic Bakery and gotten a big marzipan cake of a cock fucking\nan ass, and then another one of just a cock. Over on 70th and Amsterdam.\nThey have the stuff in the windows, and the cookies are chocolate tits. And\nBianca brought the cake in and she put the cock and balls up against her,\nand it was coffee-colored so she looked like Potassa the drag queen.\nHalston was pretending to eat it and suck it. And Catherine made a faux pas\nand said the chic thing would be to cut the cake and eat it, and he said, “No,\nthat would not be chic.” He was high and he wanted to leave it uncut. As I\nsat there looking at Bianca I started getting more and more nervous about\nInterview’s cover story next month on Jerry Hall.\nWe stayed at Halston’s until about 1:00 drinking, then we went over to\nStudio 54 in limos. Gianni Agnelli didn’t come with us, he went home to\nwait for a call about the Moro kidnapping—he’s somehow involved with\nworking out a ransom deal with the terrorists. The baron and baroness\ncame, and somehow we got lost from Stevie. They didn’t understand about\ngoing to the basement. And Stevie had the basement decorated now, with\nscarves and candles and popcorn, but it’s (laughs) like going to a St. Mark’s\nPlace hippie pad."

Fred had given me a winter coat and I really\nneeded it, it was freezing. At the end of the eighth inning when we left it\nwas 0-0 and on the way in on the radio it was still 0-0 (toll $.75).\nAveril dropped her mother’s car off at the 52nd Street garage, and then\nwe got a cab for Elaine’s. Bob was having a dinner for Baron Leon Lambert\nfrom the Belgian bank, so he had Chris Makos and Catherine Guinness, and\nCatherine was wearing a T-shirt that said “Where is Palestine?” Her great-\ngrandfather was Lord Moyne of Palestine who got assassinated there in\n1944 by the Stern Gang. She asked Leon if he was Jewish. And he’s half-\nJewish, his mother’s some kind of Rothschild. And Catherine said, “I don’t\ngive a damn. Do you realize that if Hitler had won the war, my step-\ngrandfather would be dictator of England?” Sir Oswald Mosley. The\nfounder of the British Fascist Party. But Bob said Catherine and Leon\nseemed to hit it off anyway.\nThen Chris’s boyfriend arrived, Peter Wise. So we went over (cab $3.25)\nto Studio 54’s anniversary party. We got out on West 53rd Street and went\nin the back way because there were mobs out front. We went to the\nbasement with all the gold pillows and the ceiling sounded like it was going\nto fall through from the dancing. Halston said we should (laughs) rehearse\nfor later when they brought the cake in and we had to give speeches, so he\nrehearsed his speech. Truman had a tin-foil hat band around his black hat\nand I was talking to him when YSL walked in with Marina and he gave\nHalston a really big kiss, so that was Fashion News. Yves looked like he\ncould have been on something.\nThen we went upstairs and sat on a piano in front of the curtain and the\ncake never arrived and Halston made a speech about how much Studio 54\nhas done for New York and he was good, and then he said, “And now I’ll\npass the mike to Andy.” But I already had a mike in my hand, and it’s bad\nenough not having anything to say when you’re holding one mike, but I just\nsaid, “Uh, uh, oh, gee, uhhh …” I don’t know, I just made sounds and you\ncouldn’t have heard it anyway, and people laughed, and then Bianca said\nsomething and it might as well have been in Nicaraguan because you\ncouldn’t understand it, and then she passed the mike to Liza, who was\nwearing a red Halston, and she sang something like “Embraceable You” but\nit was from The Act and it had lines like “Forget Donald Brooks/Halston\nhas all the looks.” And Bob said that he hadn’t heard such self-indulgence\nby a clique since Hitler in the bunker.

He\nmust be really in the dough, because they’re going to spend about $500,000\nfor it. Marty was shaking like crazy. I guess from coke.

He said that he was through with drugs, and that he\nwas drying out, too.\nOh, and I guess Marina Schiano’s spread it all over, that Diana Vreeland\nand Fred had a big fight outside New Jimmy’s in Paris. When he came back\nin he’d mentioned it to me, but I thought he meant they’d just had an\nargument. The real story is that Diana actually hit him and YSL tried to help\nand she said, “No, it’s a fight between Fred and me!” and she was crying\nand everything. Because she’s jealous of Lacey Neuhaus, she thinks Fred’s\nmaking it with Lacey and I think she wants him to make it with her. Can\nyou believe it? It’s so crazy.\nThe new Interview looked good. Paloma on the cover, and it has fifteen\npages of ads.\nHoveyda was giving a dinner for Mrs. Saffra at the Pierre (cab $3). We\nwent up to a whole big chic apartment right in the hotel. I sat next to Mimi\nHerrera under a Motherwell. She had a forty-carat diamond on. Poor Gina\nLollobrigida was the only person there who had fake jewelry, I think. Fake\nemeralds. She has really big tits. I should interview her. I told her she\nshould hook up with Dino De Laurentiis. She said she didn’t know him, that\nshe was doing photography as a profession now. That guy we knew in the\nsixties, Carlos, the one who always said Edie stole his leopard-skin rug,\ngave the toast. I remember he sent a contessa down to the 47th Street\nFactory to try to get the coat back. But you know, now that I think about it,\nI guess Edie probably did steal it, but only in fun."

She called it “it”\nand David asked her what “it” was and she said a girl. She reminds me a lot\nof Ivy—everything was put on. She said she was in Italy the day Moro was\nkidnapped and that she and Moro were the big things on Italian TV that day.\nShe said she didn’t take drugs in the sixties, that she’d only started recently,\nand just for work.\nAnyway, I missed my girl-lunch with David, I didn’t get any gossip\n(lunch $35). Patti lives over One Fifth and so she went upstairs and David\nand I walked over to Mays to get some supplies for the office ($32.89,\n$2.79).

Worked till 6:40 then\nwent home (cab $3.50) and glued myself and went to the Carlyle (cab\n$2.25) to pick up Jerry Hall to take her to the dinner Hoveyda was giving\nfor the Shah’s brother way down at Windows on the World.\nMick opened the door. I thought he wouldn’t be there. He was on his\nway up to Woodstock. I asked him if it was true that he’d bought 200 acres\nup there and he said no, that he was just living upstairs from a dump. He\nshowed me their new album and the cover looked good, pull-out, die-cut,\nbut they were back in drag again! Isn’t that something?\nAfter we left the Carlyle I told Jerry I thought Mick had ruined the Love\nYou Live cover I did for them by writing all over it—it’s his handwriting,\nand he wrote so big. The kids who buy the album would have a good piece\nof art if he hadn’t spoiled it. And Stevie got it into Earl Wilson’s column\nthat Bianca was “so touched” by the “Miss You” song that she “slowed\ndown divorce proceedings,” but Jerry said the song was really written about\nher. She was wearing the same green Oscar de la Renta dress she wore the\nlast time I went out with her, and when we got into the elevator I noticed\nthat she had underarm b.o., like she hadn’t taken a shower before she got\ndressed. So I guess Mick must like b.o. I didn’t have a limo but she didn’t\nmind. I told Jerry that Barbara Allen had called from England where she\nwent with Bryan Ferry. Bryan never gave Jerry her clothes back after she\nleft him for Mick—he said he was keeping them because he knew she’d\ncome back—and after Barbara had been over there once, she told Jerry\nshe’d been trying on her clothes, and that did upset Jerry, but she said she\nhopes Bryan and Barbara make it as a couple (cab $10). Down at the World\nTrade Center the wind was really blowing so that’s when I was really\nnoticing the b.o…. We went up to the 107th floor and our ears popped. The\nSecret Service was there because of the Shah’s brother, and Peter Beard said\nthe waitress and the bartender were S.S. because he’d heard them talking on\nthe way in. Hoveyda really fell for Jerry, making her kiss him on the lips.\nThe food was rotten but the sunset was so beautiful. Everybody was\ntrying to make Jerry. On the way home in a limo we picked up out front,\nshe told me her philosophy of How to Keep a Man: “Even if you only have\ntwo seconds, drop everything and give him a blow job. That way he won’t\nreally want sex with anyone else.” And then she said, “I know I can tell that\nto you (laughs) because you won’t tell anybody.” She’s so funny, she says\nsuch stupid things. But then she’ll be able to rattle off the names of every\nsingle person she met when she was in Iran. It’s what talking to Jane Forth\nused to be like (limo $20)."

Then the third number was “The Owl and\nthe Pussycat” that Liza was doing. It was a good number and if she’d sung,\nit would’ve been better. Halston ran up on stage afterwards."

Truman said he’s starting to be normal again and\nwhen I believed him he told me I was (laughs) “too naive.”\nTruman was throwing his hands all over the place. I taped, and we\ndished the whole lunch.\nHe said that after lunch he was going to his analyst and I asked why\nsomeone like him would go to an analyst and he said because it was an old\nfriend and he didn’t want to hurt his feelings by not going.\nTruman is so silly-looking, open-toe shoes and no sweater, and he said\nhe just decided that he’s going to start wearing anything. He said that Issey\nMiyake sent him a coat and he just threw it on immediately—he was\nwritten up in the papers when he wore it to Studio 54 with a white hat. We\nhad lots of drinks and it was fun, and then it got down to what Truman had\ninvited me for. Bob MacBride who he always said was a writer but who we\ncould never figure out what he did is now doing sculpture. He’s left his wife\nand kids.\nWe went back to Truman’s place in U.N. Plaza. He’s redecorated, but the\nbulldog’s torn off the buttons and the fringes from the furniture. And Bob\nMacBride brought out his—toys. His art. It was little cut-outs, like you\nmake in kindergarten. You know? Like circles, and then you paste another\ncircle over it, and you make hexagons and things. That’s what he does. And\nthey wanted me to help him get a gallery. I said he’d just missed Leo\nCastelli, that he just went out of town, but that when he got back we’d make\na lunch for Leo and him, and Leo will think that’s fun—lunch with Truman\nCapote.\nI told Truman I would tape him and we could write a Play-a-Day, he\ncould act out all the parts himself. (laughs) He could really do it—play his\ngrandmother and everything.\nHe gave me all the dirt, we dished Lee and Jackie. Lee’s got a new really\nrich boyfriend in San Francisco, that’s why she’s spending time there.\nTruman said the Ladies’ Home Journal offered him $10,000 to review a\nmovie but they wouldn’t tell him which one it would be, and then he found\nout it was The Greek Tycoon so he turned it down. I think Truman likes me\nbecause I like everything he doesn’t. He’s so nuts, you’re embarrassed\nsitting there with him. And he’s always talking about how he’s getting a\nhundred thousand for this and a million for that, but who knows.\nHe was thrilled, he said, with his Tom Snyder show a couple of months\nago, thought it was really one of his best. I don’t know why he doesn’t go\non The Gong Show.\nHome to glue. Then picked up Catherine and went to Doubles to get the\nbus to see Lucie Arnaz opening in Annie Get Your Gun out at the Westbury\nMusic Fair. Barry Landau was in charge, and I think he (laughs) invited all\nthe people in his apartment building. I really think he did. People were\ngoing in for drinks and Gary Morton couldn’t get in because he didn’t have\na tie. The doorman was so dumb, I told him, “Don’t you know that’s Mr.\nLucy?” Lucille Ball looks so old but she has a beautiful body, and she really\nwas a beauty.\nOn the ride out, Bill Boggs did some announcing, and then Gary Morton\ndid some announcing, like, “Here we go by a garbage can,” things like that,\nand finally after an hour and a half we arrived. The place looked empty, but\nthen when they saw Lucy, every old lady in pantsuits came swarming. God,\nwhy do Americans dress so bad? Do they want to look unattractive so they\nwon’t get raped, or what? When did it start?\nBut Lucie Arnaz was good, and I just love Harve Presnell, he’s the one I\nalways really loved. He’s 6’5” and Tammy Grimes had an affair with him.\nThe show was really long, I don’t know why.\nOh, a woman came up and asked for my autograph and she said, “I’m\nGloria DeHaven,” and I looked at her and it was. So I think maybe there\nwere a lot of old stars that you just couldn’t tell. A kid was throwing up, and\nit was funny because we all just stood there and watched him."

They were on the wagon but I had orange juice and vodka. I\ntaped his ideas for plays, but oh God, (laughs) they were so boring. He said\nto me, “I have so many ideas, I’ve just got so many I’ll tell you three plays\nright now,” and then he told me the first one. He said [imitates]: “It’s called\nThe Greek Ideal, and it’s about a young man and his mother, and he’s a\nGreek scholar and he’s going to Harvard and he’s maybe a little crippled.\nHis mother gives him a present before he goes away, she takes him to a\nGreek island and it’s just the son, the mother, and a maid”—I guess there\nwas a maid—“and they’re sitting on the island and suddenly the\nmmmoooooon rises and out of the moon come hundreds of little rats and\nthey eat him. And the mother is in a black hood.” Well (laughs), I didn’t\nknow what to say, I said, “Oh, that’s great, Truman, but does it have to be\nrats? I mean, there was Ben and Willard and everything….”\nAnd then Bob said to me, “Don’t you know that’s from Truman’s old\nshort story, ‘Walk Around the Block,’ which he did years ago and\neverybody’s copied it?” And then Truman told the second play, which was\nnot as bad [imitates]: “A young man of sixteen down South marries a girl\nof thirteen for her money, and he’s precocious and paranoid….” I didn’t\nreally get that one. And when he got to the third play he said (laughs), “It\nwill be improvised and we can do ANYTHING! It’ll be called Deep\nHoles.” So then I said, “But gee, Truman, can’t I just tape you, the real\nthing, and do plays about real people? Can’t I go to your gym with you?”\nSo we have a date for Friday at 11:00.\nThen after lunch we went over to his apartment and there were two\ncopies of The New York Times magazine article on him that’s going to be\nout this week, an advance copy. And the picture with it didn’t look like\nTruman, it looked just like his mother. He was in a straw hat and a bedsheet\nthat made him look pregnant, standing in the grass. And the article says just\nexactly what he did in his life, that he only likes men who have a wife and\nlots of kids, because they were the family that Truman never had, that he\nlikes to become close to the kids. And it described Truman’s boyfriend John\nO’Shea, the one that Bob and I met in Monte Carlo a few years ago. It was\nfunny, it wasn’t even talking about Bob MacBride and there he was fitting\nthe description, reading about it. Truman said, “No, not six kids, just four or\nso is plenty.” Then Truman read the article and Bob took me into the\nbedroom to show me more of his artwork. And Truman read for about an\nhour. Then Bob said he needed a nap, then Truman said he had to leave, so I\nasked him if he were going to his psychiatrist and he said no, to the gym.\nHis gym is right where the old Factory used to be, 47th and Second.\nOn the way out, in the lobby of his building, he held up the picture of\nhimself in the article for the elevator people. He said, “Look, it’s me. How\nd’ya like it?” And he was talking about the article, it said the word\n“decline,” and he said, “Decline? What decline? I’m the most written-about\nwriter in the world.” I guess he’s confusing written-about with writing."

He said he hated Bill Paley for being mean to her or\nsomething.\nWe walked into the gym and people were looking at us, we looked\npeculiar. Then we went into the room for Tony to massage him and Truman\ntook off his clothes and I (laughs) took pictures. He’s fat but he’s losing\nweight. On the way over, his pants were falling down, like a loose diaper—\nyou could see the crack in his ass.\nThen after lunch Truman took Bob MacBride, who was with us by then,\nand me to his psychiatrist. Truman had told him that I was going to be\ntaping so there (laughs) was Truman on the couch, and he was talking about\nhis father and his mother and his stepfather and how his father took his\nmoney and all that crap and the psychiatrist was saying all the things that\nthey say in the movies—“Now let’s get back to that dream you had.” And\nTruman got up and looked out the window and then at us, and he had tears\nin his eyes, he was sort of crying, and then when he was finished he\nbounced up and said, “Wasn’t that wonderful acting?”\nThen they were going home for “a little nap” and I finally realized that\n“a little nap” must mean sex with Bob—they must do it every afternoon and\nI guess I’ve been interfering—but I think Bob likes it better that I am, it\ngives him an excuse not to.\nSo we went back to U.N. Plaza. I was outside the door trying to tape\nTruman in the bathroom pissing, but he closed the door.\nThen Bob said it was time for dinner. It was just like a vacation, like\nbeing in the country—right after lunch you have dinner. Truman does really\neat only one meal a day, though, I’ve watched him.\nBefore we left Truman had a stiff vodka. Then we went over to the\nrestaurant across the street called Antolotti’s. Bob fell asleep at the table and\nTruman told him to go home.\nTruman told me that his fantasy is to make it with the psychiatrist, that\nthat would get their relationship to a “new level”—that then he would be\n“in power.” I was going to ask him didn’t he think it was so old-fashioned\nto be thinking that way, but I didn’t, I’ll save that for (laughs) another\nsession.\nHe told me that he blew John Huston forty times and then he told me\nabout Humphrey Bogart. He said that Bogart was “reeeally scared” of him\nand that one night he carried Bogart up to bed, and tucked him in and said\nto him, “You’ve got to let me do it, Humphrey.” And (laughs) he said\nBogart was really nervous and said, “Okay, but don’t put it in your mouth.”\nSo then Truman said to him, “Listen, Humphrey, we went to the same\nschool, Trinity, and I know you must have done it there.” But I don’t think\nthey did both go to Trinity. Truman makes up so much. Then later, Truman\nsaid, they became best friends and he said once they were staying together\nat somebody like David Selznick’s house, and Bogart jumped into his bed\nwith a hard-on. But Truman said he told him it was (laughs) just too early in\nthe morning.\nOh, and he said that John O’Shea stole the whole Answered Prayers\nnovel, that that’s why it wasn’t done, but I think he’s making that up, too.\nAnd he says he doesn’t want to live in the present because his book ends\nin 1965 and he’s trying to finish it. But when could he work?\nOh. And what gets him really upset and nervous is anything anal. If I ask\nhim about fist-fucking he gets so upset. He says he doesn’t want to talk\nabout it.\nBut I mean, how could anybody make it with Truman? God, I mean I\ncould never do it with Truman. (laughs) God … (dinner $52.15)."

      "text": "I went to a doctor in the morning for one of those terrible once-a-year\nphysicals where they do everything. When it’s the same nurse it’s not so\nbad, but Rosemary is away and Doc Cox has a male assistant, and so\n(laughs) it felt like you were at the Anvil. First I got a pelvic X-ray and then\na proctoscopy, that’s what it’s called, and it was too embarrassing. Doc Cox\nwent out of the room to see a lady patient and she spilled water on him so\nwhen he came back it looked like he’d peed on himself. The Doc was\nsweet. Then I picked up some things for the office ($15.21) and got down\nthere by 2:30. The lunch was for Eartha Kitt, and Barry Landau had brought\nPolly Bergen down, too.\nBrigid had already done her Eartha Kitt imitation for Eartha and Ronnie\nwas looped, saying it was his “last day” on the job—Fred had screamed at\nhim the day before that the place was too dirty, that he wasn’t cleaning up\nenough. Ronnie and Eartha were fighting and nobody pulled him out of the\nroom. The fight was over James Dean’s personality and whether he was\n“difficult.” I guess Eartha was thinking she was a rebel, too, so she was\nstanding up for James Dean, and it’s not the same thing at all—she did it for\ncivil rights and James Dean was just a person not showing up for work. And\nthe fight wouldn’t have been bad if Polly Bergen hadn’t started sticking up\nfor Ronnie, saying he was right, and then when Polly left the room Eartha\nsaid something like that she was full of shit, and then when Eartha stepped\naway once Polly said something like the same thing about Eartha, but not in\nthose words.\nBob thought Eartha was interesting enough to do a story on, but I don’t\nwant to hear about the White House, that story’s so old I don’t want to hear\nabout it. We made a date for the next day at Quo Vadis to have lunch with\nher and her daughter, Kitt, and I gave Bob the assignment of keeping Barry\naway. And Ronnie decided to stay on. Victor didn’t come by to see me, so\nthat was like a vacation, but he sent me over a present—a cock ring, his.\nWe tried to get Truman on the phone, but he didn’t answer.\nGot dressed and picked up Catherine. Her English friend Jamie Neidpath\nwas with her, he’s a land baron. He looks twenty but he’s thirty. He dresses\nin funny clothes, long stringy silk ties like the Beatles used to wear and\nfrock coats, and I asked him why he dressed funny and he said because he\njust decided once that this was the way he was going to dress forever, and\nso he has.\nCabbed to the Bottom Line ($6). Steve Paul was there, I think he\nmanages David Johansen. Lou Reed was at the next table and Catherine\nwas madly in love with him, that was why she wanted to come to this thing.\nAnd Fran Lebowitz was at another table with her arm around some girl\n(laughs) so I got a few snaps of that. And oh, David Johansen is so cute,\nhe’s just so adorable. The only thing he does wrong is jump around, he\nshould learn not to do that like Lou learned not to. Lou invited us over to\nhis place.\nIt’s on Christopher Street, between Sixth and Seventh, sort of where the\nVoice used to be, upstairs from a bagel store. When we were going in the\nkids around were whispering, “There’s Lou Reed.” He tells them, “Go kill\nyourself.” Isn’t that great? The two dachshunds he got after he saw me with\nmine are so adorable—Duke and Baron. He’s sort of separated from Rachel\nthe drag queen but not completely, they have separate apartments. Where\nLou is, it’s actually more of a house. It’s a rent-controlled thing he got from\na girlfriend, six rooms and he only pays $485 a month. The best room is a\nlong skinny bathroom, 2’ X 12’ and he said he was thinking of changing it\nbut I said not to, that it’s really great that way. And oh, Lou’s life is\neverything I want my life to be. I mean, every room has every electronic\ngadget in it—a big big big big TV, a phone answerer that you hear when the\nphone rings, tapes, TVs, Betamaxes, and he’s so sweet and so funny at the\nsame time, so together, it’s just incredible. And his house is very neat. He\nhas a maid come in … well, I guess it does smell a little of dog shit, but…\nThen he was on the phone and he ran a tape of his concert and it was him\ntrying to get the old Billy Name Factory Foto look, very contrasty.\nCatherine went downstairs and got grapefruit juice and bagels and orange\njuice. Lou only had a funny pint-size bottle of scotch."

I didn’t know what to tell him so I\njust said, “If Truman goes to the hospital, when you go to visit him, try to\nget me in.” I’ll tape it.

(laughs) No, I’m only kidding, she wasn’t\n… but they had around seventy-five girls and most of them were from\nSouth American countries you never heard of. The ex-Miss Universe looked\nreally black, but maybe it was my TV.\nI cabbed to the office to pick up Vincent, we had to go to a lunch for 600\npeople at the Plaza given by Gerry Grinberg the head of the North\nAmerican Watch Company. The paid speakers were Art Buchwald and ex-\nPresident Gerald Ford (cab $4).\nAnd Mr. Grinberg took me over to see President Ford and he said, “Nice\nto meet you.” And I told him that he’d already met me at the White House\nand he said, “Oh yes, of course.” He looked sort of out of it. I asked him\n(laughs) how his wife was, and he said she was out shopping and I said, “At\nHalston’s?” and he said (laughs) yes, that maybe she was there. But once he\ngot started on his speech he didn’t seem so out of it at all, he remembered\nthe whole speech. It was a good lunch, steak and potatoes.\nAnd on the way out we went into the Teuscher candy store in the lobby\nof the Plaza—the one where they fly the candy in every day or something—\nand I wanted to sell them an ad in Interview, but I wound up buying $200\nworth of candy instead.\nI talked to Ronnie. He told me he’s now going to one of those halfway\nhouses to stop taking drugs and drinking. He said he hadn’t slept at all in a\nweek. I asked him if he was having trouble with Gigi and he said that well,\nyes, that she’d thrown the wedding ring out the window. I don’t know why\nshe ever got married, she’s always going to run around, and Ronnie wants\nher to be like his mother in Brooklyn who never leaves the house. Now\nshe’s styling or doing makeup on the Brian DePalma movie and that’s going\nto lead to other things, so …\nWent home and called Truman, but there was no answer, I should have\ncalled before I left for work."

The old songs come back in a new way and\nthe kids think they’re new and the old people remember and it’s a way of\nkeeping people together, I guess, a way of living.\nWe got the Washington shuttle, after getting magazines and newspapers\n($3). The shuttle was packed, it always is. Paid for Fred’s and my ticket\n($81). Then got a cab to the Madison Hotel ($6.50), checked the baggage\n($3). Cab to the Móndales’ ($4). Everything is so expensive. It started me\nnoticing inflation for the first time, because everything on the menu at the\nhotel was actually double. A minute steak that used to be $7.50 is $15 now.\nAnd all your life you’re taught—you’re brought up on money, on pennies\nand dollars, and the inflation used to come in pennies, but now a dollar is\nlike a penny, things go up in dollars.\nWashington was hot and sticky. Joan and Fritz Mondale didn’t have any\nreal big artists. Just Helen Frankenthaler and me. And the reason I was\nincluded was because they had the Southwest collection and my Blue\nFlowers was in Mrs. de Menil’s gift.\nThey live in the same house the Rockefellers had when they were vice-\npresidents, but of course their Max Ernst bed is gone from the place now.\nJoan put me on her left and an Indian guy on her right. And then Joan\nwas a little drunk, I think, and she started being very sad and saying, “Well,\nthis is probably the last time we’ll see each other because you’re a famous\nartist and you’re going to be around for a long time, but they just took a poll\nin New Jersey and we’re the lowest we’ve ever been, we’re lower than\nNixon right before they got him out, and we’re slipping fast.” I told her that\nthings would pick up.\nThen we saw the treasury guy over in a corner and I said to Joan that he\nshould make dollar bills that have braille for the blind newsdealers like they\ndo in Switzerland and she said that was a wonderful idea, that I should tell\nhim, but then she got to him first and told him herself. The dinner was so\nbad. What ruined food in America? Was it those magazines like Good\nHousekeeping and Family Circle and McCall’s? They could have great\nsimple steak-and-potatoes dinners and instead they have these fancy\nconcoctions. Like veal with tuna sauce on top of it and capers. It was a\n“tented affair,” and that always costs so much, every time you put up a tent.\nAnd they had every kind of hard liquor, which you don’t get now at the\nWhite House. Then around 10:00 Helen Frankenthaler slipped a note over\nasking us if we wanted to leave.\nThen we had to go back to the hotel, and I’d been telling Fred how\nhorrible Helen Frankenthaler was, how awful she was to me last weekend,\nand then suddenly she was changed. She said, “I’ve been so awful lately, I\ndon’t know what’s wrong. I’m really going to be nice tonight.” And then\nshe was! Isn’t it amazing how a person can just change like “that” because\nthey decide to?\nAnd we had drinks with her in the hotel. Fred was bored with her but he\npaid for the drinks anyway. She was talking about her maid wanting $300\nfor four days’ work, she’s live-in. She probably just wants to leave Helen.\nHelen has three or four people working for her, she said. And she hated the\nwine, although Fred didn’t see anything wrong with it."

Later\nI heard him telling Brigid that he’d met a deaf-mute and that he was with\nhim when I called.\nBrigid was typing away and then I caught her eating candy and when I\ndid, she went crazy, she felt so awful, I had to quiet her down. I told her,\n“Now, now, it’s not so bad, you only had fifteen pieces, the day’s still\nyoung, just take it calm and easy.”\nPicked up Catherine and Jed in a cab ($4) and went to Madison Square\nGarden to see Bruce Springsteen (tickets $19).

They were all young and cute and why doesn’t\nInterview appeal to them? It should, it’s young and modern. My head must\nnot be in the same place because they were all jumping up and screaming\nfor Bruce and I was the only one who didn’t.\nOh, and Susan Blond called me earlier and said that a girl had called her\nup because she was upset because Bruce Springsteen was upset because he\nsaid I’d taken his picture on Monday night. She said that he doesn’t like\nanybody to take pictures—that his girlfriend’s a photographer and even she\ncan’t take his picture. But the funny thing is, I’d just gotten my contact\nsheets back and I was sitting there trying to figure out what night I was\nlooking at and who I’d taken a picture of—I didn’t even recognize that it\nwas Bruce Springsteen—I thought it was Al Pacino. I’d forgotten where I\nwent! Why is Bruce Springsteen big, though? He talks the dumb way. Like\nSylvester Stallone. Is that why these people are big? Because they talk that\nway and people identify?

We kept asking him how it felt to be an idol\nwith thousands of girls screaming, and he was insisting that it didn’t change\nyou, and then we walked through the lobby, through the screaming girls,\nand (laughs) he changed. He was so different. The limo came and he had a\nwhole different personality.\nWe went downtown because he was going to be photographed for\nInterview by Barry McKinley. Shaun just turns into something else when\nhe’s being photographed, something just happens to him, he just falls in\nlove with himself. And Barry has a different style of saying things when\nhe’s photographing—instead of saying things like Scavullo and those\npeople say, like, “Marvelous, marvelous,” Barry says (laughs), “Give it to\nme, motherfucker. Push it out. Push out all you can.” “What kind of drug\nare you on, motherfucker?” It was so unbelievable that I went and taped it.\nLater at Madison Square Garden in Shaun’s dressing room there was a\nbeautiful girl there, his girlfriend, and he had on stretch pants with his big\ncock showing, and he brought the band in to give them a lecture on when to\ngo slow and how to turn on the thirteen-year-olds. It was funny.\nWhen we went out to our seats Shaun’s mother Shirley Jones was there\nand I bent over to say hello where she was sitting and she looked scared,\nbut then I said, “I’m Andy Warhol” and she grabbed my hand and was\nsweet and she introduced me to her husband Marty Ingels. Then Shaun\ncame on. He jumped through a hoop like a lion and the girls went crazy.\nThey took me on stage and it was the first time I was ever on stage at the\nGarden. Smart little girls were screaming: “Andy.” And he does sexy things\nwith the microphone, he puts it between his legs and he touches his cock a\nlittle, and he’s like a Mick Jagger for the young kids."

And Brigid and I are thinking all the\ntime that maybe Truman never did write any of his own stuff, that maybe he\nalways had some butch guy there to do it. To do rewrites. Because I mean,\nTruman showed me a script he did, and it was just awful, and when he\nshows you these things you can’t imagine that he could even think they’re\nany good, they’re so bad. And I mean, he went with Jack Dunphy for years,\nand these guys are all supposed to be “writers” but you don’t really know\nwhat they write, and now Bob MacBride gets his name on things, but he’s\nnot good, so maybe that’s why Truman’s work has gotten so … because he\nhasn’t done anything in ten years, and that’s a long time. And I mean, the\nthings Truman says are interesting, so somebody else could find clever\nways to make them good on paper.\nThe car picked me up at 3:50 and Catherine and I rode out to Montauk,\nit was a nice ride. We stopped at Burger King and picked up a couple of\nsteak sandwiches for Mr. Winters ($5). When we got to Montauk I gave Mr.\nWinters and his wife Millie the sandwiches and a painting I brought him, an\nabstract—it was a Shadow. I also brought some Interviews and I think his\nwife liked the magazines better than the sandwich, and I think Mr. Winters\nliked the sandwich better than the painting. I thought he could put it away\nand keep it. I tried to get Mr. Winters to be in the movie, but he didn’t want\nto be in it. There are so many kids at the place. Twenty were out shooting\nand there were still so many. Said hello to Winnie, Tom’s Danish wife, who\nI see is actually beautiful, after all.\nWent over to the yacht club hotel and checked in. Tom brought his\nBetamax by. Ulli and his wife Sukey came. We had dinner at the yacht club\nand it was terrible, the place was rotten. Jack Palance who’s in Tom’s movie\nwas staying there at first but he hated it, they were so rude.\nThen at midnight we went to Southampton to one of those beautiful\nmovie houses to see the rushes from the day before, and the movie looks\nsort of good, lots of airplane shots and Jack Palance, and Tom is sort of\ngood, and the band plays in the movie, so I guess that’s what he’s actually\nmaking the movie for, to introduce his band. They drove me back to the\nyacht club and I fell asleep with my clothes on."

It didn’t come in the\nmorning so we didn’t get on the flight at noon. But right after 12:00 it\narrived, so the driver picked me up at 860 and then we picked up Fred and\ndrove out to Newark to get a plane. The driver was nice (tip $10).\nThe plane left on time. What we were really having to go out there for\nwas a dinner that Marcia Weisman was giving. That meant we’d be missing\nthe big glamorous YSL Opium party in New York on the Chinese boat\ndowntown at the South Street pier.\nChecked into our hotel, L’Ermitage. It’s for people who don’t want to be\ndiscovered—if you’re having an affair, that’s the place to go. There’s no\nlobby, and it’s chic in a funky way. It was very elegant.

      "text": "Went to Getty Museum. It was thrilling. A reproduction of a building they\nhaven’t excavated yet in Italy—they know where it is but there’s another\nbuilding on top of it. Bought a book on painting ($17).\nBob arrived in L.A. and described the YSL Opium party for us. Then\nJoan Quinn arrived in fuschia hair and lots of matching amethysts. Fiorucci\nsent a limo in exchange for us going to their opening. We went to pick up\nUrsula Andress first. She’s staying with Linda Evans. The house is very big,\nEnglish country-style, a pool and tennis courts. Ursula was wearing a YSL\nscarf over the cast on her broken arm. She was surfing in Malibu with Ryan\nO’Neal when Hurricane Norman hit her and broke her arm, tore it out of her\nsocket. Joan whispered that everyone in L.A. wonders if it was Hurricane\nRyan that actually did it.\nWe went to Fiorucci where we ran into Ronnie Levin with Susan Pile\nand Tere Tereba. Susan screamed that the party was cancelled but we\nthought that was just a joke and started to get out of the limo but a cop\npushed us back in and said we were blocking traffic, that the party was\ncancelled by order of the Beverly Hills Fire Department. A transvestite\nhanded us business cards through the window.\nThen we went back to the hotel and then I went with Sue Mengers and\neveryone else waited around for Mick Jagger to call. Sue is really fat again.\nAnd God, her attitude is so cheap. There was no dinner, so she suggested\nwe stop at Burger King on the way to Diana Ross. It was so abstract, you\ntalk into a machine. She ordered a double Whopper but then she worried\nthat maybe two separate hamburgers would have been cheaper.\nSue treated the driver like dirt and I know that if I ever said one little\nremark to her that she didn’t like, she would never speak to me again. She\nsaid she’d introduced Isabella Rossellini to Martin Scorsese and that\nthey’ve been living together for two months. She hates Jerry Hall because\nJerry told Bob Weiner that Sue wanted to take an acid trip with Timothy\nLeary. “What do they think I amww.” Like it had ruined her reputation. So\nvulgar. God. Arrived backstage and she said, “I’m Miss Ross’s agent.” A\ncute little waiter was serving meatballs. She said, “If we knew there would\nbe meatballs we wouldn’t have had to stop at Burger King.” I got myself\nreally drunk drinking straight Stolichnaya. Sue told me she’d just been\nreally after John Travolta, to represent him, but he reminded her that she’d\nturned him down when he was on TV in Welcome Back, Kotter and she\ndidn’t remember it. But then, she said, sitting on the toilet seat one night she\nremembered it.\nThen Diana Ross came out looking really lovely. Thrilled to see me,\nkissed me. Then she went on stage. She had a shot of brandy in her coffee\nbefore she went on.\nWe were sitting in the seventh row. Universal Amphitheater. A plane\nwent over with lights on it that said, “Welcome to my show.” Laser beams\non the stage. She came out of a big screen, down an elegant staircase. Her\nbrother is cute. I want him photographed in Interview. She told me she got\nthe whole idea for her show from the Interview photo of guys carrying her\ndown a staircase.\nDiana didn’t say she liked her cover and I just know it’s because it made\nher look too black. At the end of the show she did a Wiz number and she\napologized for the music being too slow, and said, “Forgive me, audience,”\nwhich she didn’t have to say because no one knew the difference.\nAfterwards, backstage, Diana started to cry. She wanted to have another\nrehearsal tomorrow. Then Berry Gordy and Diana had a fight, he told her he\nwasn’t going to spend the money on another rehearsal. Diana wanted Sue to\ntake her side, but Sue said it wasn’t her area and then she said to me, “Let’s\nget the hell out of here.”"

Wendy did them with me, and Fred was being funny and lied\nand told everyone that the shaved vagina in the painting was Wendy’s.\nThen we went to Polly Bergen’s house in Holmby Hills. Polly’s house is\nvery modern and well-decorated. There were Architectural Digests\neverywhere. And her dressing room looks like a department store, with\nracks of blouses and skirts and dresses and gowns, and she has a telescope\nthat’s for looking at the stars, but she uses it to look at the stars’ houses, and\nwe looked into Danny Thomas’s house across the canyon, but nothing was\nhappening there except a few geraniums were growing.\nThen back to our dump (room service tea with tip $3, breakfast $2).\nWendy made a phone call to Stan Dragoti to invite him to the opening—\nhe’s really unhappy about Cheryl Tiegs running off to Africa with Peter\nBeard. Then it was time to go off to Julia Scorsese’s and she told Fred on\nthe phone to be sure no one we brought had any drugs on them because\nshe’s trying to get more straight.\nWe got to Julia’s and everyone was sitting around smoking joints. Tony\nand Berry Perkins, Firooz Zahedi and his fiancée, a lot of young writers and\ncomposers. Tony asked us how was Chris Makos doing these days, he said\nChris was the biggest hustler, but that he was so seductive you ended up\ngiving in. He asked me if I liked L’Ermitage, and I said it was a good quiet\nplace to have an affair, and he said, “But could you have two affairs there?”\nAnd Doug Christmas told us earlier that Ronnie Levin had had a friend\nkeep the receptionist busy while he walked in, took one of my drawings out\nof the frame, rolled it under his arm, and walked out. Then he had the nerve\nto try to sell it back to the gallery, and they pressed charges and the police\nsaid he had a record a mile long.\nFred’s outfits on this trip were his new shirts from London—they’re\nreally long so they look like Indian tunics—and Sue Mengers said to Fred,\n“In New York your hair is slicked back, you wear beautiful suits and\ngorgeous ties, and in L.A. your shirt’s hanging out, there’s no jacket, no tie\n—oh I know you, you probably said, ‘This is good enough for those\nHollywood Jews.’ “"

The one Barbara\nAllen “auditioned” for.\nThe movie—I’m not sure, I think it was a light comedy. It didn’t say\nanything, though. It’s good in the beginning and you think something’s\ngoing to happen, but it doesn’t. The new girl, Mary Steenburgen, is okay—\nshe’s good, but not beautiful. She looks a little like Anjelica and you just\nknow that’s why he did it, and he just should have used Anjelica, but that’s\nwhen they were having the Ryan O’Neal troubles.\nAnd you know, I was thinking the other day about commercial movies\nand then all the great art movies, and I’ve decided something: Commercial\nthings really do stink. As soon as it becomes commercial for a mass market\nit really stinks. I know I always rave and say my favorite movies are things\nlike The Other Side of Midnight and The Betsy, but I guess I’m … going to\nchange my tune. You have to do stuff that average people don’t understand,\nbecause those are the only good things. And even though the arty foreign\nmovies are boring to sit through, at least they try to do creative things. So\nI’m going to start going to the New Yorker and seeing strange movies again.\nI’m missing so much, going to parties.\nI was a little drunk and I went over to Jack and said I really really loved\nit, because Fred told me those kind of things really do make a difference to\npeople.\nAfterwards Catherine and I went into this place on 54th Street that said\n“Female/Male Nudes,” and there were almost naked girls on like a big long\nbanquet table with men sitting around and it’s so abstract. They put their tits\nand asses into the guy’s faces, an inch away, and the guys just sit there like\nzombies. And there’s a sign that says “Do Not Touch.” And one of the\nhookers looked at me and said, “Oh my God, oh my God.” And then the\ngirls came over and one said, “Oh will you buy me a drink?” And I did—I\n(laughs) didn’t know yet that the drinks were $8.50 apiece. And then more\ngirls came and they made me feel really good, like I was straight, and they\nkept saying to come upstairs, that upstairs was really really really fun. What\ndo you think was up there? Is that where they do it? And the girl told\nCatherine she would really like it up there, too, she was trying to make\nCatherine, and I bought drinks for the other girls so that’s 3 X $8.50 plus $5\ntip ($30.50) and then 8 X $8.50, plus $20 ($88) until I ran out of money.\nThen we left and went next door to a gay porno movie. Catherine wanted to\nsee it and it was a glory-hole movie and it was too peculiar and we just\nstayed for ten minutes (cab $3)."

I think that’s how I started collecting\nAmerican stuff—I got my first cupboard from them, the cupboard that’s\nnow in the Interview office, the one they keep the pencils and rubber\ncement in (catalogues $6, $22, $8, $10).\nVictor said that Halston had been trying to reach me to invite me to the\nbenefit for John Warner that Liz Taylor Warner was having that night. Liz\nlooked very fat, but very beautiful. Chen, her secretary, was there. But John\nWarner wasn’t even there. Liz was upset at how awful the party was.\nHalston told her he would have just given her the $10,000 if that’s all she\nwas getting from it. Some face doctor that said I’d met him in California\nthree years ago started talking to me, he said he was screwing all day and\nhad come seven times. I don’t know why he was telling me. He asked me\nhow old I was and I said, “Thirty-five,” and he said I looked forty-five. He\nsaid (laughs) that if I go to him I can look like “a normal thirty-five-year-\nold,” because he would do nutrition and things. I guess that’s why he was\ntelling me he was screwing, that I could come seven times if I went to him,\ntoo.\nThen Aline Franzen who was in charge of the party decided to do her\nauction thing but nobody at this thing was about to buy anything—they\nwere all just wearing the teentsyest jewel you could buy at Bulgari, or\nsomething. Aline said, “This is my painting that I did myself with my whole\nheart and who will bid on it?” And nobody did. Finally Liz hit me and said,\n“You better bid on it,” and I said no, that I wanted to bid on the two tickets\nto Studio 54, and finally Liz screamed, “All right, I’ll take it myself,” and\nAline said, “No, Liz, you can’t” and Aline threw herself on the floor and\nwas crying and it was such a comedy and then Liz’s secretary Chen said she\nwould take it, and Liz screamed, “No, Chen, you can’t, you don’t have any\nmoney.” And Lee Grant was an auctioneer, too, she auctioned off two teeth,\nporcelain ones I think, for $2. I’m telling you, nobody in this crowd was\ngoing to buy a thing. Oh, poor Liz. And Aline said, “You rich people are\nbeing cheap.” And then John Cabot Lodge got up and made a peculiar\nspeech because he talked about the Red Enemy, and it was so weird. Then\nHalston and Liz said they would meet afterwards at his house.\nSo Halston and I went to his house together. Liz sneaked in later and he\ngave her some coke and she got high and happy. I told her, “Look, you’ve\ngot nine days until the election, you’ve got to really get down and talk to\nthe Negroes.” I said, “This lady stuff isn’t going to work.” And she said,\n“Oh lawdy lawdy lawdy.” And I told her, “Listen, if you lose the election\nand you leave your husband, I want you to play Truman Capote for me on\nBroadway.” So she started laughing and went into a trance and tried to talk\nlike Truman, but she couldn’t remember how he talked.\nThen Victor and I went into the kitchen and I fed Linda potato chips\nunder the table which I wasn’t supposed to do, which was fun, and Halston\nand Liz were talking intimately in the other room and he told me later that\nJohn Warner wasn’t fucking her.\nI told her, “Elizabeth”—you really do have to call her Elizabeth—I said,\n“Elizabeth, it would be so great to see you in the White House.” And she\nwas cute, she said, “Oh but I just want to be a senator’s wife, I mean, can\nyou imagine me in the White House? A Jew and married seven times?”"

Tommy Pashun came down with flowers.\nStevie gave me a Quaalude and Halston said, “For the box, for the box.”\nVictor’s told him about my system, how I drop everything people give me\nor that I get in the mail into a box at the office. Victor used to bring me\nsome of Halston’s notes like from Jackie O., but then Halston realized he\nshould start saving them himself. These ladies really do write notes—when\ndo they find time? And I’m invited to Jackie O.’s Christmas party again. We\nmust be on somebody else’s list, though, not hers. Because we weren’t\ninvited to the party Jackie gave last week. Robert Kennedy, Jr. told Fred\nthat they had a big question about whether to invite us and decided not to.\nJackie really is awful, I guess. She invited Jann Wenner and Clay Felker.\nThem she invited."

Truman said that Ivan\nKarp had seen Bob MacBride’s art and said he’d put him in a group show in\nDecember of next year.\nRod and Alana were in the back, I introduced them to the manager.

Right as I was talking to\nPhyllis she finally realized that I was the person who’d asked if I could\ndraw her foot in around 1958. She was just starting out then—it may have\nbeen at the Bon Soir or someplace, and all these years she never put it\ntogether that that was me and this is me, and so she said, “Oh, you’re the\nfoot fetishist!”\nPhyllis didn’t eat much. Tommy Smothers was with us and so was\nTommy Tune. He said that Elaine’s had the best food he’d had in so long,\nand everybody looked at him like he was nuts.

Because Barry had sent a bottle and\nsigned it from her. And Tommy Smothers was tongue-kissing Phyllis and so\nI said, “If you can tongue-kiss her, you can tongue-kiss me.” So he gave me\na quarter of a tongue-kiss and said he’d give the rest when he knew me\nbetter.\nThen we went to Studio 54 and it was very empty. John Fairchild, Jr.\nwas there and he asked to borrow money, so I ripped a hundred-dollar bill\nin half and that upset him, but it was a memorable moment. And I didn’t\nrealize it at the time, that he probably had his coat on only because he didn’t\nhave enough money to check it.\nAnd Halston is funny—no matter how many times we run into each\nother on the floor he grabs me and hugs me and kisses me and says, “It’s so\nnice to meet you, Mr. Warhol.” Paid John Fairchild, Jr. for bodyguarding me\n($20)."

I got so red and was telling him\noff, and then he was screaming things like that John Fairchild, Jr. was my\nboyfriend—you know how horrible René is—and it was like one of those\nold Ondine fights, and everybody was stunned to see me so angry and out\nof control and screaming back at him. And do you know that René has an\nagent now? And do you know who that agent is? Gerard Malanga. And I\nmean, René acts as if he’s such a wonderful writer, but he just has one idea\nand he keeps repeating it over and over—about how he’s wined and dined\nby the rich and how you should get things for free, that same old stuff.\nLuckily Henry Post missed this fight, he was at another table.\nI have another opening on Saturday, this one was just a preview.

I went up to the decorator’s and he has like a private entrance in a big\nbuilding. It’s a beautiful office but it’s decorated horribly. He had paintings\nlike I’ve seen at other people’s apartments, they’re just like scribbles and I\ndon’t think he paints them, but it’s somebody’s paintings. I just couldn’t\nface asking him whose they were. I’m going to, though. He wears\nChristopher Street clothes, army boots and a leather jacket and chinos, and\nhe has a mustache and a beard. He looks like Victor, like a Gay Bob doll.\nThen he took me upstairs to see his partner’s apartment, and she had a\nduplex with more scribble paintings.\nThen we went over to the Sedakas’ apartment.

Truman looked like Dr. Frankenstein had\njust finished with him. He had scars up and down and across his face. He\nlooked like he had the little screw missing. Then we cabbed over to Dr.\nOrentreich’s office ($4) and we slipped in the back way. It was like\nsneaking in with Garbo. Okay, let me describe Truman’s costume: He had a\nscarf over his head, then a funny little hat with folds in it and a babushka\nand a jacket and a scarf over his mouth and dark glasses and a leather jacket\nand a coat. I mean with these scarves and funny hats draped all over him, he\nwas so conspicuous. Otherwise nobody would have noticed him and he\nwould have been just a strange person with blood leaking down his face.\nAnd he decided he wanted more done—he wanted more pain, I guess—\nso he was going to have the fold on the bridge of his nose done, too, right\nthen. It’s an operation that Truman says he invented and that Dr. Orentreich\nhas rehearsed on two women first, and now he was ready to give it to\nTruman.\nThere were eight really beautiful nurses. It was like watching Hugh\nHefner and his Bunnies. And they said to Orentreich, “What a great sewer\nyou are, doctor.” When he was done tucking Truman’s furrow—the furrow\nhad been about a quarter-inch and the scar was about three inches—they\nglued him up. Truman was awake, and he said it didn’t hurt, but I don’t see\nhow it couldn’t have. He made an appointment for Monday to take the\nstitches out.\nThen we cabbed back to U.N. Plaza and Truman was talking about “our\nmagazine.” He said that in addition to the big editorial meetings, he wanted\nto have an opinion page and letters-to-the-editor column and now I’m just\nbracing myself for some letter to arrive from his lawyers.\nHe says his next improvement is hair transplants. He said his troubles\nwere all because of John O’Shea and that now he really hates him. But then\nlater Brigid told me that he had her send O’Shea a subscription to Interview."

When he was so cheap and wouldn’t stay in a hotel, Monique gave\nhim her bed, and now he says she uses him. He’s mean, he’s really mean. At\n1:30 the Eberstadts wanted to leave and I dropped them off (cab $3.50)."

Then got into the\nlimo and went over to the pier building where the party was and it was the\nbiggest party in the world—they had trees hanging and the whole place\nlooked like Central Park, but without the muggers. Elizabeth Ashley was\nthere and she was sweet and adorable and friendly. She said she saw me at\nthe Knicks game about a month ago.\nOh, and the weirdest thing. Oh, this was so ridiculous. This old man\ncomes running over to me and kisses me on both cheeks and my lips and it\nwas just disgusting and it turned out to be Leonard Bernstein, and he was\ncarrying on, everyone was looking, saying he’s been desperate to meet me\nfor twenty-five years and that we had to get together and talk, and that we\ndesperately must see each other tomorrow. Really, everybody was staring.\nAnd then Doc Cox came and said he wanted me to meet his new boyfriend,\nso he took me away and then Leonard Bernstein found me again, and it was\nmore of the same, and it was such a camp. I mean, I remember in Pittsburgh\nthis friend of mine saying a queer conductor was in town trying to pick up\nboys, and that was the first I heard of Leonard Bernstein. And he was\nhugging me and kissing me more, then putting me down at the same time.\nLike he’d say a big compliment and then the next sentence would be a put-\ndown. Things like, “I always wanted to meet you but everyone told me\nyou’re a creep.” Things like that. I finally got away from him."

She’s thirty and she’s pretty but she\nhas caps on her teeth, I think. They asked me where I found Fran and I said,\n“In the gutter.” And then they asked me if I’d read her book, and I said no. I\nhope it came out right. What they were actually saying was that since she’s\nso good, how come she writes for you. I asked Fran to help us interview\nJessica, and she said she didn’t do interviews. And then she didn’t have her\ncolumn for us, so we were upset. She actually did give funny lines, though,\nthis time. She told Jessica she loved King Kong, and Jessica said she hadn’t\nseen it. And Jessica said to Fran, “I loved your book,” and Fran said, “I\nhaven’t read it.”\nPicked up Jed and Paulette Goddard and we limoed to the armory for the\nCartier party that Ralph Destino was giving to celebrate the anniversary of\nthe Santos Dumont wristwatch that he got Bob to help get celebrities for.\nTruman was there in his sailor’s cap—he looks like he’s lost a lot of weight.\nIt’s strange. It’s as if they took his face and chiseled off some of it. It’s not\nlike he looks younger. It’s just thinner. And his scars are all gone. The only\none left is the one from the fold on his nose. And Monique Van Vooren was\nthere, she said that Nureyev was coming. And I said are you sure, and she\nsaid, “Don’t worry, if he’s getting a free watch he’ll be here.” And right\nthen he walked in. He really looks so old.\nMr. Destino spent so much money to get the airplanes into the armory—\nthe wristwatch was invented for a pilot—and the whole party probably cost\nabout $100,000, but it just didn’t work.\nRobyn Geddes’s mother, Caroline Amory, was there, and Lynn Wyatt,\nand Joanne Herring. And Catherine was there, she’s very fat but she looks\nbeautiful. Like a sexy English fatso, a beautiful body, but all filled in. Like\na jelly jar.\nPaulette was wearing so much jewelry it must have been $3 million\nworth of rubies, and she was saying she wants to sell off her paintings, and\nshe was saying how much money she had. She decided she didn’t want the\nwoman’s watch, that she wanted the man’s watch, and she told Mr. Destino\nand he said fine. The watches they were giving were $1,300 watches, and\nthey gave eight of them, and I guess they cost them $600 apiece. Marion\nJavits didn’t know who Mr. Destino was and she said to him, “These\nwatches are crap,” and he said, “I’m the president of Cartier.” And so she\nwas going crazy because she couldn’t get out of it—literally going crazy.\nFinally I told her, “Well look, Marion, it’ll be a memorable evening for him\n—he’ll never forget it.”\nBob and I took Paulette home. And Bob was gushing and sentimental\nand telling Paulette he loved her, and so just to make things lighter I said,\n“Gee, Bob, you never tell me you love we.” And so I go home and fall\nasleep and the phone rings and it’s Bob saying that he’s never said so but\nthat he does love me, and I mean, what’s wrong with him? Is he flipping\nout?"

The airplanes\ngot lots of publicity.\nI called John Fairchild, Jr. and invited him to Elephant Man, and he said\nhe’d go, and I said that he’d probably cancel later and he said no, if his life\ndepended on it he wouldn’t do that. And then I got home and sure enough\nthere was a long note, cancelling, saying that “a friend came unexpectedly\nto town.” And I just don’t know how to handle that. What should I do?\nBecause I just knew he would do it. Should I tell him I never had tickets\nanyway, that I just wanted to see what he’d do? Should I tell him that? Or\njust say I didn’t care, or maybe I should go to the other extreme and make\nhim feel really really guilty because I just know he feels terrible about it. He\nprobably didn’t sleep all night, but I mean, he knew he wasn’t going to go\nand no friend came to town, so why did he say yes in the first place?\nElephant Man is Equus with an elephant instead of a horse, but I\ncouldn’t stand Equus so how could I like this? But all the actors are good.\nAfter the play we went to Mortimer’s to pick up Catherine. When we\nwere leaving, Sam Green insisted we come and see his new place before we\nwent down to Studio 54, and so we went there, and Sam’s really got a great\nplace. You open the door and there’s these big stairs, and I was kidding\naround telling Catherine right in front of Sam that he was a big cocaine\ndealer and he didn’t say anything, so now I don’t know if it’s true. It’s the\nnew kind of place—empty with nothing in it but a rug, and then that photo\nof him with Garbo at the King Tut thing. And Sam really does get around,\nhe traveled all over with John and Yoko, talking to the Dalai Lama and\nthings. Catherine broke her shoe, she really is fat.\nThen as we were leaving, across the street there was a party for China\nSyndrome going in and they yelled to Sam, “Can Andy Warhol come to the\nparty?” So we went over, and we saw Jim Bridges and he’s really the hottest\nnew director now. He said that Jack wasn’t there—Jack Larson, our old\nfriend Jimmy Olsen from Superman—that he was back in Hollywood. Jim\nis a big star director now, so he wasn’t as friendly, he was acting more\nHollywood. He’s on Easy Street now.\nOh, and Bob was all upset in the afternoon because he was expecting\nMr. Destino to call and give him a Cartier watch, but he didn’t.\nFriday, March 16,1979\nCabbed down to Chembank ($4) then walked to the office. Fred told me I\nhave to go down to Washington on April 6 to teach crippled kids how to\npaint, and I’m not looking forward to it. It’s for Phyllis Wyeth. Fred went\ndown to Leo’s because Leo just sold a painting of mine, so that comes right\nwhen we have to pay more in taxes—it eased the blow for a second.\nDavid Mahoney was giving a St. Patrick’s Day party at Halston’s. I\npicked up Catherine, and we went to the Olympic Tower (cab $3). Curley\nwas waiting for us. He said he’d been invited, but he wasn’t, really, he just\ngot in using our name. The Kissingers were just leaving and I told Nancy\nI’d just met her aunt and she said, “Oh yes, the crazy one.” We talked to\nGovernor Carey and he liked Catherine.\nIt was wall-to-wall celebrities. Truman was there. Steve Rubell was not\nso friendly to me, he’s being cool, somehow, I think because I’m friendly\nwith Henry Post. Walter Cronkite said hello, he was cute, and he introduced\nus to his daughter who’s an actress. And I met the kids of Mahoney who’re\ngood-looking now. The girl used to be heavier and dumpy, but now she’s\npretty. She was in the same green Halston as the year before."

Her Iranian performance was cancelled, naturally,\nbut I don’t see how she can do it at her age, it’s so hard, traveling like that.\nWe talked about cosmetic surgery. I remember somebody telling me once\nthat when Martha was down and out, a kind couple took her in and gave her\na facelift and then her career revived. Now maybe she’ll get a hand\noperation, too, she said, because really her hands are just like little stumps.\nI told her I saw her dance in Pittsburgh in 1948 and she said she was\nfrom Pittsburgh, and Halston was surprised, he didn’t know that, he said\nthey’d never really talked. Halston gives her clothes, and somebody else\ngave her money to redecorate, but instead of redecorating she bought one\nexpensive thing instead of doing the basics, but she said it was just because\nshe didn’t have time to do the basics, that she’ll get to it. Halston served\ncaviar and baked potatoes. And when Halston serves baked potatoes and\ncaviar, it’s always with like a pound of caviar. I don’t know if it’s really\ncaviar these days, though, because with all the trouble in Iran, where can\nthey be getting it? They may be just making it up.\nAnd the Du Pont twins called me at Halston’s, they were calling all over\ntown for me, and I wouldn’t take the call, and then they had the nerve to\nring the doorbell and they were drunk and giggling and I went to the front\ndoor and told them off.\nOh, and Halston’s mad at Bianca because she never arrived from\nLondon, and it was supposed to be Mohammed’s day off and Halston had\nhim wait at home all day, and when he called her in London she said that\nshe had food poisoning, but he didn’t believe her because he’d heard her\nuse that excuse over and over again on other people while she was staying\nat his house."

And\ncategories disappear. It’s like Deco—you hardly ever see a Deco piece\nanymore. People just get them, and then they put them away, and they’re all\ncollected up, categories go (catalogues $8).

I’m going to buy\nskates today.\nThen we went to the Stage Delicatessen and had good Jewish Celebrity\nsandwiches. The “Diana Ross” was the worst, though—liver with jelly and\npeanut butter. Then we stood on the corner and John went to 54 with Curley\nand I dropped Belle (cab $4)."

Then went over to pick up\nBlondie. She lives in the great building on 58th and Seventh. Blondie—\nDebbie—was sweet, her hair was fixed up, and you’d never believe she’s in\nher thirties—no wrinkles and so pretty. She said her grandmother lived to\nbe ninety-five and all her family looks young. She spends all her money on\nmakeup. She must not have been pretty all these years, though, or I would\nhave noticed her. She must have tried to look bad or something. But I guess\nsome people look better, actually, when they get a little older. I didn’t know\nwhat to call her. I guess I call her Debbie. But when I introduce her, I call\nher Blondie. But Blondie is the name of the whole group, so … She was\nreally great on the ride out, she didn’t complain about anything and she\ndidn’t want anything.\nSo we got to Brentano’s and the thing was a big dud. The store didn’t\nadvertise that we would be there until that same day’s papers, which didn’t\ncome out until one, and so even if people did read it they wouldn’t rush\ndown, probably. But the kids who came all came just to see Blondie, they\ndidn’t care about me, they were a whole new young crowd. What they did\nwas go next door and get copies of her record and had her autograph that.\nThen Debbie had to get back to rehearse for her new album. We got back\naround 5:00. After we dropped her, Rupert and I went for a late lunch.\nWe had aquavit and caviar ($70). We were getting drunk talking\nbusiness, and we didn’t pay attention when a guy next to us was down on\nthe floor screaming, and finally he said, “Oh, can I have your autograph?”\nand it turned out to be John Lennon! And I just wished we’d noticed him\nbefore—he was with Yoko and her mother and it would have been so much\nfun. John’s very skinny now. I don’t know what kind of diet he’s on, maybe\nrice. They live at the Dakota. Then I went home, and I was drunk so a\nmovie was out. I really can’t drink in the afternoon."

He was so tired he fell asleep, I had to get him up\nat 10:30 because we had to pack and go to London. We had to buy some\ntickets ($600) at Lufthansa (tips $20, cab to airport $25). Took British\nAirlines, it was okay, a really big plane, jam-packed, one of those DC-10s, I\nthink. Cabbed from airport to the Savoy ($30). At the airport while waiting\nfor bags, we heard the people talking about Martha Graham coming in, that\nshe’s old, and they should send a cart for her. We waited for her a little\nwhile but she never arrived.\nChecked in at the Savoy and Martha arrived with Ron Protas, they were\ncoming in from Denmark. Ron is Martha’s right-hand lady. So Martha and I\nstood there talking, it was fun, she was very tired. Learned Dr. Giller had\nchecked in, tried to get him, but he was out. Liza and Halston hadn’t arrived\nyet, they were coming in on the Concorde (tip to porter $5, room service\n$5). Read the Martha Mitchell book, slept an hour.\nThe rooms at the Savoy were small and dinky, on the courtyard, but not\nreally a courtyard. Small. So expensive. Then Nick Scott, the good-looking\nrich English kid who was the butler of Bianca during the period when he\nthought he’d lost all his money, invited us to have dinner with him and his\nwife at the Savoy Grill—he’s in the bucks again. Sabrina Guinness was at\ndinner, and she’s been going out with Prince Charles a lot, and we think she\nfucked him. Fred met Halston in the lobby so he told him I would call him\nas soon as I could.\nWe had a really good dinner, the Grill was great, and Sabrina and I went\nup to Halston’s room and I started taping Liza for her Interview interview.\nSteve Rubell was there with Randy and they had a bedroom and a sitting\nroom, and Halston had an adjoining bedroom with Victor Hugo, and the\nnext room was Dr. Giller. He had the prettiest room—it was purple and\nwhite overlooking the river, and it was fun to see everybody in a new place.\nSteve wanted to go discoing, he was carrying his portable radio around,\nturning it up and down. Victor was changing his clothes, putting on\ndifferent outfits. Bianca was in another room with Peter Sparling, the\ndancer with Martha Graham."

It was terrible food. Then we\ndecided to do the discos. Halston was the most fun person on the trip. He\nwould call up every place and say, “Hello, this is Steve Rubell, the owner of\nStudio 54. Can I get in free?” He was just camping the whole time—the\ntour guide. Bianca had to wear all her Halstons while he was in London,\nand she was unhappy because Mick had called her and had a fight about\nJade. He said he can have more children and she can’t, and she got insulted\nand said she could. They do use Jade as a prop, and they make each other\nreally unhappy. He wanted Jade to come over for his birthday, but Bianca\ndidn’t want to let her, she said it was bad publicity with the Pallenberg\nboyfriend’s suicide.\nThen we went to Tramps, stayed about half an hour, it was fun.

Nice Italian lunch\n($100), and after that we got some flowers for Catherine’s mother ($20) and\nCatherine took us to see her stepfather’s mansion on Cheyne Walk. Whistler\nlived there once.\nVictor and I went back to the hotel (cab $7). It was Martha Graham’s\nopening at Covent Garden. We all got ready and met in Halston’s room—\nJohn Bowes-Lyon, Dr. Giller, me, Randy, Steve, Victor—Fred went off with\nhis date, Sabrina Guinness. Liza went on before us.

I asked him how could he do that and he\nsaid, “You’ve got to do that, you’ve got to always keep them on their toes\nand pretend you’re rich, really really rich.” He kept screaming at the place,\nand nobody wanted to give any tips.

I mean, they were clear and sharp, but Liza’s not fat and they made\nher look fat, and like a drag queen. The expressions were wrong, too.\nRichard Bernstein’s going to have to do a big creative job on them for the\nInterview cover.\nLater that night we cabbed to Studio 54 ($4). Steve was at the door and\nhe said that Valerie and Robin Williams were inside and he brought me over\nto them. There’ve been stories in the papers that they were getting divorced,\nbut Valerie said it wasn’t true. Cheryl Tiegs came in with Peter Beard and I\nguess she wanted to have her picture taken with Robin but Valerie said no,\nno pictures. Valerie’s very tough, she runs things, and then she turned to me\nand asked if I thought it was okay that she was that tough, if she should be.\nShe said that Robin was invited to Fire Island for the weekend but she\ndidn’t want him to go. She said, “It would be too big a strain on both of us.”\nSo then I thought that maybe she’s afraid he could be a fairy. She said she\nwanted them to go someplace like Nantucket instead.\nI introduced her to a cute waiter named Robert who wasn’t working, and\nshe seemed sort of hot for him and they danced but then she got nervous—\nmaybe she’d just wanted to get Robin jealous for a minute. He’s still\nwearing the clothes we bought that day down in the Village. He’s got such a\nfunny-shaped body.\nSteve was smoking a joint and when the person who gave it to him\nwanted it back, Steve started screaming."

I talked to Shirlee\nFonda. She said they sold their East Side New York house on 79th Street to\nDavid Brenner, but then he backed out at the last minute, he said that he\nwas too famous to own a house. She said that if Henry Fonda could own a\nhouse, David Brenner could, too. But she’s very happy because now they’re\nrenting the house for $5,000 a month and making more money that way.\nWhen she was cleaning the place out, she found a big gold cross worth\nabout $20,000 behind the bookshelves and they’re going to try to find out\nwho it belonged to. She said that she wouldn’t have felt right keeping it. I\ncould see that Suzie really wanted it badly, she likes gold crosses.\nWe went back to Frolic’s to change.

I’m sure\nthey’re his because they’re sort of darkened.\nSuzie was rolling a joint and it was embarrassing. I had one of those\npeppermint drinks, mint julep, and I threw it out.

And her boyfriend had even said to her,\n“Why are you pretending you had nothing to do with the Judson?” I guess\nshe was just a dumb dancer who must have picked up what they were doing\nand just made it, somehow. I don’t know how. She acts like she feels she’s\nmore important than them now. It was fun to talk to her.\nGeoffrey Holder was there, and Geraldine Stutz, all the old-timers. It\nwas a nice party. And then we went to New York/New York. Lester Persky\nwas there and he was fun, and Jack Martin, I always have a great time with\nJack Martin, he’s so much fun. He said that the Marilyn portfolio that I gave\nJoyce Haber was getting mildewed in her basement, and that once he was\nable to get Rona Barrett to give him the Marilyn poster I’d given her by\nsaying, “Oh Rona, what do you have that stupid thing for?” and so she gave\nit to him. Jack knows about art, he has a few things. I gave Joyce the\nMarilyn portfolio after she wrote that big article on us in the L.A. Times in\nthe late sixties and she’d just broken up with her husband, Doug Cramer, so\nI thought the portfolio would cheer her up and it was before I knew how\nmuch they’d be worth. They’re so expensive now."

Halloween was so big this\nyear, people were really dressed up in the cars, outfits with lights blinking.\nAt Studio 54 the place was done up just great. You walked in and there were\nten doors on each side and you had to go through each one, and there were\nmice in plastic running under your feet. And another room had a hole and\nyou looked in and there were eight midgets having dinner and you could\ntalk to them. They were eating chicken bones.

Then it was 6 A.M. and Marina and I left, and\nthere was a riot outside, people still wanting to get in. Jack Hofsiss who\ndirected Elephant Man went by in a limo and gave us a ride, there were\nabout twenty boys in it.

It was sort of good, a really cheap kind of pizza, all\ndough and a little ketchup and a little cheese. Like the cheese doesn’t come\naway when you eat it, there’s not much. And when I was there I noticed that\nshe had a pile of food on the stove, and she said it was for good luck, you’re\nsupposed to have it piled on the stove on New Year’s. So I was there and we\ntalked, and she was asking me about my house, and I told her how much it\ncost to run it, and she felt that I was being “real” and that she’d really gotten\nsomething out of me and that this meant we were friends or something, I\ndon’t know. I was waiting for it to get light out, and it never did. I mean, it\nwas 6:30 and it was still dark, and I thought the sun came up at 6:00, but I\nguess that last year when I left and it was light out it was 7:00, not 6:00."

The old fogies were coming over and saying who’d just died. That\nday. We were at a table with the Zilkhas and an ambassador from Turkey.\nThen “Suzy” wanted to leave. She agreed to walk home.

She said that the chauffeur was in the back\nwith her really just trying to wake her up.

He said he had this one shot all set up, everybody was in\ncostume and makeup with blood and everything for a fight scene and it was\nsnowing, just perfectly and they said, “Okay, stop, everybody break for\ndinner,” and he said he practically got down on his knees pleading, “Please,\njust let’s get this one shot, please, I’m a fellow worker, please, I’m Rocky!”\nand they wouldn’t let him.

He’s like Rubber Man.\nHe had the bodyguard who was the bodyguard Tom Sullivan used in\nCocaine Cowboys, so we talked about Tom. Sylvester talked about the\nAcademy Awards, he said he hated All That Jazz. He said the Academy\nAwards ignored him and Woody Allen this year.\nHe said he’s about to go to Hungary to do a movie, an action movie, and\nthen after that he wants to do the Jim Morrison story. I told him we were\nreally good friends with Jim, and that Tom Baker was his good friend and\nthat he should talk to Tom who’s in town, by the way, and he’s calling me.\nI told Stallone he should do the Linda Lovelace book. He said that he\nwas worried, I guess, that he was a one-movie person, and he named a few\npeople that were one-movie people. He named somebody from The Boys in\nthe Band.\nWe were there for about an hour. His wife had gone into the other room\nand she didn’t come out to say goodbye, I don’t know why."

Fred invited a couple of Swedish people, and Chrissy Berlin\nand Byron the pool player who’s somebody Zoli fell in love with, but he\ndoesn’t want to be a model—he plays pool and thinks modeling is too\nfrothy. He knows everything, like that at British Airways on Tuesdays and\nThursdays on Park Avenue, you just sign in and there’s free shrimp buffets.\nAmina, the black model who’s writing a play, kept saying, “Where is\nthat Richard Gere? He’s supposed to be here!” But then when he came he\ndidn’t pay attention to her, so she didn’t like him anymore and she came\nover to where I was signing Kennedy posters. Robyn brought the lunch\nfrom 65 Irving, but then Brigid ate every bit that was left, so he didn’t have\nany.\nThen it was a beautiful day so I said why didn’t Brigid and Chrissy and I\ngo over to University Place to see if Bea was in her antiques shop. We\npassed out Interviews to the junkies who’ve moved from Park and 17th to\nthe corner of 14th. Then we were all in Bea’s and Brigid said she’d be right\nback, that she was going across the street to get a pack of cigarettes. And a\nsecond after she left, I heard a big noise and a thud, and I just knew. I ran\nout, and there was Brigid lying in the street with a truck one inch away\nfrom her fat belly. Then she got up and she was laughing and she said, “No\nno, I’m all right.” It was a truck from an art restorer. The kid was sweet, he\nwanted to take her to the hospital, but she was so relieved she was all right\nthat she said no. She was just scared out of her wits. Chrissy was so nervous\nshe had to go home.\nI was so happy Brigid was alive that I told her she could have anything\nin the world so she had ice cream cones ($.75 x 4 and $.90 cookies from\nGreenberg’s and then cake $12, Big Macs $8.52). We walked around for an\nhour to make sure she was okay. All we could think about was here\ntoday/gone tomorrow. I hope it taught her a lesson to be more careful.\nThen we went back to the office. I told her she could have the rest of the\nday off but it turned out they needed her. She went to an A.A. meeting and\nthen came back. Fred was really drunk at the office, he’d been to the Cecil\nBeaton memorial thing. He was talking like Diana Vreeland and making\nbusiness calls, so I just hope he called the right people."

And we got to the\ntheater and the ticket lady said, ‘Do you two ladies realize what you’re\ngetting yourselves into?’ And my friend was so excited she was going to the\nmovies she kept saying, I’m so thrilled, I’m so excited.’ So we get into the\ntheater and like in all pornographic movie theaters, there’s nobody there.\nJust about twenty men, most of them asleep, they’ve slept through the thing\nseven times and don’t know where they are, and the movie comes on and\nmy friend’s eyes were popping out of her head. She hadn’t seen anything\nfor ten years and now she was getting Deep Throat. And for days after that\nshe called me up saying, ‘Diana, do you think that girl’s hurt her insides?\nHow did she do it? Her throat must be all bruised.’ And I said, ‘Well, I don’t\nreally think about things like that—to me the whole movie was a romance.’\n“ And Bob said, “Diana, how could you do that to an old lady?” And she\nsaid, “What else do you take someone to see who hasn’t seen anything in\nten years?

But as Brigid had the earphones in and\nwas listening to the tape she got ten different colors on her face. Sharon was\nsaying things like, “Well yes, if Brigid leaves her job, yes, I’d love to take it\nover.” And then Brigid thought I was being mean, giving her the tape, but I\njust forgot we’d said anything about her on it.

But I think I convinced\nher she had four. I named the flavors. Chrissy’s weight is going up. She’s\n145 and Brigid is 166½. Brigid was in a state of shock for the rest of the\nday, she stayed until 6:30.\nI called Brigid when I got home. She and Chrissy had just gone to dinner\nand had dessert.

So then they left and I stayed alone with Rupert.\nDropped him off (cab $4). Then glued myself together because I was\ninvited to Prince Abudi’s dinner for Marion Javits.\nHis place was just around the corner, at 10 East 68th Street, and as I’m\nwalking in, in comes Ultra Violet, wearing the same dress from the sixties,\nwith the same gold coins, and I said, “Gee, Ultra, you shouldn’t do that—it\nmight have been a camp when a gold coin was worth $35 but now they’re,\nyou know, worth $775 apiece, so you should be careful.” But she said she’s\nhad to sell most of the good ones, she was just wearing her pesos, very\nheavy pesos. And it was really fun seeing her again, I kept asking her,\n“Well, who invited you, how did you get here?” I think she’s a good friend\nof Marion’s. I have a funny feeling that maybe she services people or\nsomething, I have a funny feeling that maybe that’s it—like when there’s a\nguy, an older guy maybe, she’ll go out with him or something. But she was\nfun. I spent the whole evening with her because it was a really awful party.\nAbudi was very quiet. Although he’s a Saudi Arabian prince he didn’t have\nany young princesses there, so it was just all the people I know, like Sam\nGreen and Kenny Lane, and Marion’s boyfriend who makes holograms.\nAnd she likes him. I don’t see what she sees in him, but he’s the mistress.\nWhat would you call a guy who a woman sees? A “lover?” A gigo —no, a\nlover, I guess.\nAnd who else was there? Oh, the Bulgaris came, but I didn’t get a\nchance to talk to them, because Ultra Violet went to the caviar dish and she\nsaid it smelled like a tin and then Kenny Lane came over and said it was the\nbest caviar you could buy, so then she decided to eat half a pound of it. And\nshe said she was going to write her memoir. Oh! And she finally told me\nhow she got sick. It was all over Ruscha, the artist, Ed Ruscha. She had\nfallen madly in love with him and he had a wife and he just couldn’t handle\nit, and she just went too crazy because she was too in love with him, she let\nher whole nervous system fall apart. And that’s when she was eating a piece\nof gold every day—somebody told her that Indian people eat gold or\nsomething like that, and it ate a hole in her stomach.\nAnd now Ruscha doesn’t have the wife but it’s not the same. And she’s\nlooking for another young somebody. It ended up we were there until 3:00."

I had a fight with the cab driver, he wanted to go the way he wanted\nto go. Richard wasn’t invited but he was Catherine’s date.

He’s very insecure and he does drive you up the wall, but he’s nice. He thanked Diane for inviting\nhim, but she hadn’t. Harry Fane was there, and Barry Diller. It was a party for Nona Summers and her husband,\nwhose name I always forget, so they think I’m wigged out. That’s the new thing they’re calling me. Like in\nNewsweek they called me that.\nThe same people as usual… Berry Berenson and the Niarchos kids, who it’s so funny to listen to after you’ve\nheard Fred imitate them, the lisps. And Barbara Allen was running around saying that all her boyfriends were there\n—Mick Flick, Mick Jagger, Philip Niarchos, and Bryan Ferry. Barbara looked gorgeous.\nDVF said she couldn’t wait to read Popism, and that everybody loves it. And then Silvinha arrived with\nRichard Gere and said that I was her sixties, so she’d try to be my eighties.

And in the bedroom they were all taking stuff. And Harry\nFane was putting the make on Silvinha or her girlfriend that she was talking to, he put on the “Fuck Me” look. And\nBarbara Allen was running around saying who should she go home with. And then just as I was quietly slipping\nout, Richard Weisman saw me and was screaming, “Andy! Andy! Are you leaving?” And then he wanted to leave,\ntoo, and he does his thing of saying goodbye to everybody, just what I didn’t want to do. And then in the car he\nsaid, “Do you think I made a mistake the other night, going to bed with Catherine?” I said, “What?” I mean, I\nknew that he and Catherine had had sex once a while ago, but now here he was saying that they just had it, and I\nmean, I can never bring it up to Catherine because it’s too embarrassing. And Richard was saying how he felt\nguilty and did I think that was why Catherine quit, because when you do it with somebody you work for, then you\nthink you always have to do it."

Then São\nSchlumberger arrived and we invited her to lunch at this waterfront place. Then we were picked up for the opening\nand there were at least 3,000 or 4,000 people there, you couldn’t get in, it was horrible, and finally we slipped\naway, they were giving us a party at a place called something like City Hall, a drag nightclub. Finally after three\nhours of waiting, this drag queen with hair on his chest came in and I was talking so she told me to shut up, she did\na couple of numbers and then all of a sudden pushed me aside and stormed out and we didn’t understand what had\nhappened, but somebody said she was too emotional because she was singing for me, she gets that way. But it was\ntoo boring. Fred got insulted because the TV lights were shining on us too long, and told Lucio off, that it was the\nmost ridiculous evening, and that Lucio had wasted our time because that kind of evening wouldn’t sell pictures,\nand that he was just using us to get into show business. We didn’t get into bed till about 4:00."

When we came\nto the outskirts of Rome the driver didn’t know how to get into the city. We had to follow a cab to take us to\nGraziella’s office to pick up two tickets to have a private audience with the pope. Suzie was very upset because it\nwas too exclusive for her to go, so she gave Fred her cross to have blessed.\nWe got our tickets and then the driver dropped us off at the Vatican. When we saw 5,000 other people standing\naround waiting for the pope, too, I just knew that Graziella hadn’t gotten us a private audience. But Fred put on\nairs and went up to the guards and said that we had a private audience with the pope and they laughed.\nThey finally took us in to our seats with the rest of the 5,000 people and a nun screamed out, “You’re Andy\nWarhol! Can I have your autograph?” She looked like Valerie Solanis so I got scared she’d pull out a gun and\nshoot me. Then I had to sign five more autographs for other nuns. And I just get so nervous at church. And then the\npope came out, he was on a gold car, he did the rounds, and then finally he got up and gave a speech against\ndivorce in seven different languages. There was a bunch of cheerleaders saying, “Rah-rah, pope.” That took three\nhours. It was really boring, and then finally the pope was coming our way. He shook everybody’s hand and Fred\nkissed his ring and got Suzie’s cross blessed. He asked Fred where he was from and Fred said New York, and I was\ntaking pictures—there were a lot of photographers around—and he shook my hand and I said I was from New\nYork, too. I didn’t kiss his hand. The people next to me were giving him a gold plate, they were from Belgium. The\nmobs behind us were jumping down from their seats, it was scary. Then Fred was going to take a Polaroid but I\nsaid they’d think it was a machine gun and shoot us, so we never got a Polaroid of the pope. As soon as Fred and I\ngot blessed we ran out.\nWe decided it would be fun to make up a good story to tell Suzie, so we went to have lunch on the Piazza\nNavona ($45). We made up that we’d had a private audience with the pope and that he liked Fred so much that he\nasked us to lunch and then he forgot to give us back Suzie’s cross."

But then when I asked him in the morning, he said that he\nhadn’t, so I don’t know. All I would’ve had to do was look, but I didn’t. And I get so scared when I’m alone\nsomeplace, and I don’t keep people’s phone numbers—I should, but I don’t. But I will from now on.\nWe got to the airport, Charles DeGaulle, really really fast so we had an hour and a half before the plane. Then\nthere was a black guy in the waiting room and I wondered (laughs) how he could afford to be getting on the\nConcorde. And then he said to me, “You haven’t photographed me yet.” But I still didn’t know who he was. And\nthen suddenly I figured out he was Dizzy Gillespie! He’d just been in Africa and he said things were great down\nthere. He was adorable, so cute. He said he loved Africa, that there was a lot of dirt on the ground, that he liked\nthat.\nHe said he’d been photographed by a famous photographer once, and at first he didn’t remember who, but then\nI think he said Carl Van Vechten, and that made sense because he was in the Somerset Maugham biography I just\nread and he was jazzy, he always had these jazz people. Dizzy said he had a new book out and we said we wanted\nto interview him, so we took his number in New Jersey.\nAndrew Crispo was also on the plane. He’s bought all of somebody’s Art Deco collection. He had a Dunand\nvase with him, and he was with a cute boy.\nDidn’t see Dizzy get off the plane (tips $10). We went through customs easy because the customs guy was\nreally impressed with the picture of us with the pope on the top of the bags. We got out and our car wasn’t there, so\nwe jumped in a cab ($.75 toll). All the way in, even though it was the middle of the transit strike, there was no\ntraffic! The driver kept saying he didn’t believe it. We sailed right in. But at 89th Street when Fred got out, a lady\njumped in our cab who didn’t speak English because there’s a rule on that you have to have at least two people in a\ncar during the strike. I saw a cop making a girl with a car give some kid a lift. So everybody’s meeting people.\nIt was really a beautiful, beautiful day. There were so many people out walking because of the transit strike.\nWandered to the office. Brigid and Robyn were there. I worked all afternoon, waited for Rupert who didn’t arrive\ntill 6:30 because he walked. Brigid and I went out passing Interviews. A bag man started screaming that if I would\nonly stand still he could get a picture of me. He was really screaming, looking through his bags for his camera.\nAnd then I asked him if I could take a picture of him and he said no, but I did, anyway. He really had a camera\nwith a flash that worked. Maybe he was a playwright or somebody doing an article on what it’s like to be a bag\nman. He was about forty."

I\nshould be 136.

She was\nvery pretty and tall and spoke English well. We were afraid to ask her anything about Roman Polanski until the\nvery end and then she told us she didn’t have an affair with him. She was interesting, but not as fascinating as\nJodie Foster. She speaks six languages and she could just redo every Ingrid Bergman movie. She looks like what\nIsabella Rossellini could look like. We dropped her off at the Navarro. She’s been in town three weeks and wants\nto stay forever. She’s staying with Milos Forman and I guess they’re having an affair, because she was saying\nsomething about making dinner for him during the Academy Awards.

Jackie Curtis\ncame in in full drag and pink slippers and kept interrupting me to ask if he was interrupting anything. I told him no\nbecause actually he wasn’t. He didn’t eat anything because, he said, he was on a diet and had already had a half a\npound of ham and three eggs that morning for breakfast. He wanted some Popisms so I gave them to him. He was\non his way to a fashion show so he left. But then later he came back again. This time he was interrupting and he\nwas drunk. But Kimiko and John Powers had come by and Kimiko loved Jackie and if you can believe it, she\ndidn’t even realize it was a man. Jackie looked good, he’s lost weight. He said he wanted to take Brigid’s job, her\ntyping job, and he said he’d be very good, that he’d just type in a corner. But oh, he talks right into your face.\nJackie had a sequined shirt on and was wearing a bracelet he said I gave him but I don’t remember. Then he gave\nbracelets to Brigid and Kimiko to try to buy their affections."

We went over there and then Larry\nand Marisol arrived by limousine. We met the director who had a phony high-class accent. Larry was fun. He\ndecided to make the director work and said, “Where should I stand? What should I say? How should I look? What\nshould I think?” and things like that. I think Carly liked my portrait the best because she’s paying for it. I only had\none there, but Larry had five and one of his had a Chinese couple fucking in the background, and they made him\ntake it out. And then afterwards they wanted to shoot us in front of blank easels listening to Carly, and Larry said\nno, that he’d submitted to what they wanted by taking the fucking couple out, so he wouldn’t do this corny thing.\nThen Larry and Marisol came to the office for lunch. Marisol was cute. She invited me to her fiftieth birthday\nparty at Chanterelle, that very chic small restaurant downtown, but she said not to tell anybody it was her fiftieth.\nWorked till 8:00. John Reinhold picked me up. Henry Geldzahler came and met us, we discussed the poster\nsome more, and then cabbed ($2.50) to dinner at Da Silvano on Sixth Avenue. It was good but it wasn’t as good as\nthe first time we were there (dinner $98.40). The owner went out and bought the Times because Henry had a half-\npage interview with him in it and he was afraid it was going to say something unfavorable, but it didn’t. Then we\nwalked to the Ninth Circle because Henry wanted some interludes. The place was filled with intellectual fairies\nwho wanted to talk to me about my art, but Henry told them I was too dumb to do it.\nHenry thought of a good quote about Popism: “It’s a real can opener.” Isn’t that great? Oh, and I’m forgetting\nthe most glamorous thing of the day is that Jackie O. called me twice at home and missed me and once at the\noffice, about would I give a quote for Diana Vreeland’s book Allure that’s coming out that’s pictures with captions.\nShe said, “It’s like your book Exposures,” or something like that."

The dance came out good, really great, and Martha was\nthrilled because she’d been worried about it. Nureyev danced, he was awful. Saw him in the dressing room and\nsaid hello. Bianca was wearing a Halston dress with an Ossie Clark coat. And the dress was beautiful, it was flesh-\ncolored in a V on top so it looked low-cut.\nAnd the best thing was Diana Vreeland eating a banana. This banana was lying around Martha’s dressing room\nand Diana really wanted it so she peeled it and just ate it right from the peel, and it looked so funny. She’s old\nenough to look really really funny. She loves bananas.\nAfterwards we went over to Halston’s and had a little supper. We tried to pick up some of the dancers and bring\nthem with us but Halston said Martha wouldn’t like it. So it was just Martha and Bianca and me and Diana and\nJohn Bowes-Lyons.

They agreed that if he got drunk, he’d scream for hours. And this girl said she\nwould just do everything for him, get up at 5:00 and make him breakfast, and then she’d go to the set, and then\nleave half an hour before he did to go home and make him dinner.

Bianca had a great Halston top on and a blue bottom and her ass\nreally was wide. She had on Manolo shoes and an Elsa Peretti belt. We got there just in time. Halston keeps using\nhis aging models because he feels they were loyal to him so now he’ll be loyal to them.\nCabbed to 860 ($5.50). Catherine was having a lunch for Alexander Cockburn and the P.J. O’Rourke guy from\nthe National Lampoon. A writer-photographer from Stern wanted to be photographed with me for the preface for\nhis book, and Henry Wolf, an old friend of mine, was there to take a picture. He was the art director of Harper’s\nBazaar in 1960 and he changed the look of the magazine. It was either him or Marvin Israel, I can’t figure out\nwhich, who first used ugly girls with big noses and things. And I guess Mrs. Vreeland probably encouraged it\nbecause actually it was, now that I think about it, just like putting herself on the cover.\nThen the limo came at 2:30 to take us to Princeton for a book signing that Wilson Kidde set up for us. Ian\nMaxtone Graham from Brown came with us.\nThey had a place set up to sign outside. It wasn’t a rich bookstore like the Harvard Coop. This was more just\nlike a little bookstore in a building, so it was better being outside because the kids going by would see a crowd and\ngo up to see. Then we had a tour of the campus. Really rich-looking. A naked rugby team ran by doing their\nnumbers, just wearing jockstraps, some kind of initiation or something.\nThen Wilson took us to an all-male club for dinner, the Ivy Club, and just a few girls came by for drinks.\nChampagne punch. All these rich kids. The grandson of Seabrook frozen vegetables. The son of J.D. Salinger,\nMatt. He was really good-looking. He’s trying to be a photographer and he writes. A cousin of Frolic Weymouth’s\nfrom Chadds Ford was there. And a kid who didn’t belong to the club, Ritt, who was a model for Elite, but he\ndidn’t look like one—he had a big nose and beautiful eyes but he was short.\nI bought books. One was the Liddy book ($20.92).\nDinner at this all-male club was leftovers. Like spaghetti al dente, cheese on top. Baked alaska with Häagen-\nDazs that was 2’ X l’ that Ritt made. Four bottles of wine.\nWent back at 9:00, the drive was nice."

He’s the\nstudio person that brought us out to Hollywood in ‘69. And he wanted to meet Henry Geldzahler. And so I made a\nlunch with Henry for Wednesday.\nI met Bob in front of his house and we walked to the Plaza for the JOB Ball—Just One Break—and we’d\nmissed the cocktail hour. All the old bags came out for this. Nan Kempner was there with Jerry Zipkin. Robyn’s\nmother was very sweet. She and Bob chatted, they’re having the same problem—somebody is signing them up for\nall these magazine subscriptions and they keep coming in the mail. I sat next to Mrs. Tony Curtis. And so I said,\n“Oh, I wish I was home watching Tony Curtis on Moviola.” And she said yes, that she liked Tony a lot but that\nthey were just breaking up. They’d been married twelve years. She was nice.\nSharon Hammond was there with her new beau, Lord Sondes. She’s gained five or six pounds and she was\nporking it up. And the lord has a potbelly, too. I couldn’t believe it when I saw her eat a whole roll. I took it away\nfrom her.\nAll the old presidents of the ball got up there, São and Chessy Patcevitch and Sharon’s mother Mrs. Long and\nNan and Jean Tailer and a couple of other heavy-duty ladies. They gave door prizes.\nThen Bob and I went to Linda Stein’s party for our agent Joan Hyler. When we got to the party one of the\nphotographers told me, “You’re the biggest one here,” so that’s always a letdown. Paul Morrissey was there with\nhis two nieces and Susan Blond and Sylvia Miles, and Sylvia said, “You’ve got to hear my songs,” and I said, “Oh\nyeah, I can’t wait.” And she said, “You don’t have to—I’ve got them right here in my bag.” So I had Linda Stein\nput them on the record player and they sounded good to me but there were eight different record people there and\nthey didn’t react. And then Linda came over to Paul and said, “Oh listen, I mean, you’re the only person here who\nrealized that I’m wearing emerald earrings and have Regency furniture and Lalique, and if it wasn’t for you telling\nthem, they would think it was junk. So thank you.”\nLegs McNeil who started Punk magazine was there."

Jerry’s script that he’s writing is actually called The Painter—not Painting—and he’s\nwriting it for Jack Nicholson. I should tip Jack off that he should just buy the Jackson Pollock story.\nRupert Everett was there, he just got kicked out of the Blackstone and now he’s at the L’Elysée, or vice versa.\nHenry had his new lover with him that he’d picked up from NYU, and he was having me take pictures of them\nkissing. He’s going out to California soon to see his old boyfriend Raymond who’s out there posing for David\nHockney—Raymond takes planes just to go pose. At the end of the lunch Henry said to Gerry Ayres, “But what’s\nthe painter going to paint? I mean, that’s the story, so what’s it going to be?”\nCabbed uptown ($4.50) to glue and then walked to Sharon Hammond’s. I was met at the door by Tony Curtis’s\nwife, Leslie, who was staying with Sharon, she was really looped. She said she was a rich society girl from Boston\nand how could she marry an actor and a Jew. Sharon was in the bathroom. Her boyfriend Lord Sondes had just left\ntown and they’d been eating all the time, and this was Sharon’s first time in the John after all the food, and Leslie\nsaid she’d walked in on her doing her grunts. And then Sharon’s so meticulous with her makeup that it takes\nforever, too. Sharon was surprised when I said I would have a vodka. She has big tits.\nI’d brought a copy of Popism to give to Marty Bregman who we were seeing later because I thought he might\nbe interested in producing a movie of it, but of course I had to give it to Leslie. Cabbed to East 57th Street ($3) to\nMarty Bregman and Cornelia Sharpe’s apartment. We went up to the penthouse. It was one of those funny parties\nwith aging girls and sort of funny people. I guess people there were somebodies, but stars today look so mousy you\njust don’t notice them. For half an hour I didn’t notice Al Pacino sitting in the corner.\nI wasn’t letting Sharon eat because she’d gained weight. I introduced her to Al Pacino, and so she liked that. He\nsaid, “Hi, Andy.” Leslie picked up a guy with big hands. He was a hometown friend of Cornelia’s and she said,\n“Don’t worry”—(laughs)—“she’s in good hands.” Cornelia looked fat. And Alan Alda was there with this lady\nwith dark circles and it turned out to be his wife. She looked like Anna Magnani. She’s not the wife you’d think he\nwould have, but she looked nice—I’m sure she must be if they’re still married. We rode down in the elevator with\nthem. We left Leslie with a stiff drink in her hand. Dropped Sharon ($3)."

After he does that, artists’ stories will be more popular and\nyou can really sell your book Love Affair for a movie.” Ruth said maybe she could get Nick Nolte to play Jackson\nPollock.

So it’s just like confession, that’s all it is except you can go to confession every day and I guess you\ncan only be born again once.\nJohn Cage was there and Merce Cunningham and Louise Nevelson who came at the end of the dinner but had a\nspecial place saved for her. George Segal and his wife. Joe Brainard. It was nice to see him again after all these\nyears, but I didn’t get to talk to him much, really.\nMarisol looks good for fifty. She made the birthday cake in the afternoon and it was really just beautiful—\nbeautiful marzipan figures, beautiful beautiful figures fucking, and she gave me one and Halston one and they\nwere like little jewels.\nWe told Marisol she shouldn’t tell her age because people would never know and she said she thought they\nalready knew because it’s always in all the catalogues and I told her people don’t read the catalogues, and she said\n(laughs) well that then only the forty people or so that were there at dinner would know."

      "text": "We got to Lynn Wyatt’s house, fifty people for dinner, and she had cream of crab soup and then barbecued filet\nmignon that’d been marinated for twenty-four hours and hot curried fruit and homemade Rice-a-Roni which Joan\nQuinn who was there said was Armenian-style. And creamed spinach and then this great dessert which was fruit\nice cream piled onto a big meringue. And the dinner was for Diane Von Furstenberg and Barry Diller. There were\nall these crazy people from Dallas and Fort Worth. They were really rich with big rocks and they were really\nvulgar and funny. Divorced and out for kicks.\nAnd then after dinner we went into the living room and everyone loved Lynn’s portrait. Diane said she loved it\nso much that she wanted me to do her kids’ portraits, but I know she doesn’t mean it. And then John Travolta\narrived with thirty people. He was going to come to dinner but he wanted to bring thirty people so Lynn had said\nno. And he’s so good-looking. He had on a black silk shirt and a bright green linen jacket and black pants, and his\neyes are so blue. He was with this cute little girl and a lot of bodyguards, and with Jim Bridges, who directed\nUrban Cowboy. And then there was Debra Winger who’s the female star of the movie, and she’s great, we want to\ndo something with her. She told me about high colonics and that she’s full of shit. Her family was there, and her\nboyfriend. He was cute, Jewish.\nAnd Barbara Allen and Jerry Hall were making fun of ladies with jewels right in front of their faces. And\nMaxime Mesinger the gossip columnist came with John Travolta, too, and she gave him a dinner first. Then we got\na ride with Barry and Diane. Barry got mad because Jerry and her sister Cyndy and Fred were so drunk they\nwouldn’t let him out of the car at his hotel, and he wasn’t in that good a mood anyway, that’s just how Barry is. He\ntold Jerry to shut up and she got really hurt. And Fred was pretending to stick his finger up Jerry and her sister and\nthen sticking it in everybody’s noses."

      "text": "We all went to the Cadillac Bar for lunch which has really good Mexican food. And I was sitting with this crowd\nfrom Dallas-Fort Worth.\nI met Travolta at lunch again. Got an autograph on a napkin.\nThey all have these big Jerry Hall accents. And they all love Jerry because they can talk real Texas with her. We\nhad frogs’ legs and beef and chicken and shrimps, everything barbecued and chilied and guacamoled. And it was\nso hot out, it was like ninety-five degrees. And the air-conditioning broke down and the Texans say, “Turn up the\nAC! Maybe you need some freon, Charlie.” And then we went to a few Western shops to get our costumes for the\nUrban Cowboy premiere.\nWe finally got back to the hotel around 5:00. Everyone met in my room. Jerry was wearing a solid gold and\nrhinestone skintight cowboy suit with matching hat that George Hamilton gave her that he had worn in the Hank\nWilliams movie, and she said that Alana wanted it so badly and he never would give it to her and so not to tell\nAlana.\nThen we got into a limo and went to the Gay Lynn theater, it was named after Lynn Wyatt. And there were\nthousands of paparazzi and fans because they’d never had a world premiere in Houston before. And they were\nscreaming, “Andy! Andy! Andy Warhol!” And Jerry and I were posing for pictures. And then Jerry and Lynn Wyatt\nwere standing in front of the theater with the TV crew and Lynn was becoming like Barbara Walters: “And now we\nhave the famous artist, Andy Warhol, and Jerry and Cyndy Hall who’re stars in the movie, and say, Jerry, where’d\nyou get that costume?” Very professional, she was wearing purple suede with her great figure. And we got in the\ntheater and sat down and in front of us were Liz Smith and Iris Love in matching cowgirl outfits. And Liz’s\nbrother, because Liz is from Texas.\nAnd Diane Von Furstenberg was walking up and down the aisles like she owned the place. She was wearing\ntight pants and a little top and a vest with a little sheriff’s badge that said “Disco Sucks.” And then she was\nwearing two tons of diamond and gold jewelry from the forties. And Barry Diller was sitting right behind us, and\nthen in walks John Travolta with a thousand people around him, and he sat down right behind us, and everyone\nwas going crazy with the photographers and stuff, and we were all jumping in with our cameras. And then the\nmovie started and everyone loved it.\nAfterwards we took our limo to Gilley’s where they shot the movie. We left one second early so we got there\nbefore the mob (tip $20 to the driver).\nThere was a mob scene around where Barry Diller and I were sitting because John Travolta sat down two\ninches away. His eyes are just like—dyed—blue-green. I mean, really deep blue. And he has the most beautiful\nsmile. His teeth must be polished every day. And his skin is beautiful. And he’s so nice. And he says nice things to\neveryone. And he was talking the most to this girl he thought was with us, but she was a DVF groupie. And Diane\nis so desperate to be recognized that if one person says, “You’re Diane Von Furstenberg, I love you,” she says,\n“Come with me,” and she makes them follow her around for the rest of the night so that she can have a following,\nand then she gives them presents—she carries lipsticks and compacts with her to give out, and she autographs\nthem.\nAnd, well, once Travolta was at our table it became really impossible because the crowd just pushed in on us,\nand this policeman was standing right behind trying to protect us, and he was drunk, the policeman, and I said,\n“Don’t look now, Bob, but you have a big gun and a big cock one inch from your neck.” And the policeman said,\n“Can I do anything for you?” and Bob laughed and said, “Just stay right here.” And he did. And he had two guns in\nhis holster, very good-looking, and he kept hugging us and bumping into us and rubbing his cock against us and\nsaying, “Is there anything you need, anything you want?” But he was great because he kept screaming to the\nwaitress and got all this food for us. The whole table. And all these drinks, and beer. And he said, “You’re not\neating your pepper,” to Bob, and Bob said, “Are you kidding? It’s so hot, I only took one bite,” and he said, “Well,\nI’ll just show you how to eat a pepper,” and he took the whole big thing and slipped it in his mouth and ate it and\nthen winked at Bob.\nI was the second biggest star after John Travolta. But a distant second. He got the most fans after him. They\nwere screaming on the stage that everyone was going to have to leave if they didn’t let John Travolta have some\nroom.\nGot home around 1:00. Started to read Princess Daisy, it’s an awful book, but they mention me in it, so it’s\nsomething for the box. It said Daisy was too chic to go to an Andy Warhol party in London."

Babies are so hard to photograph, they never sit still and they’re teething or something so they’re scrunching\nup their mouths and they’re so cranky and I just hate them. Then Edmund called from Arizona and said that we\nshould do the baby alone, but by then it was over—I’d only done the baby with the mother and the mother alone.\nDropped Rupert ($5). I glued myself and went to meet Alan Wanzenberg and Stephen Webster, friends of Jed’s.\nWe went to Inagiku. I’ve been having too much wine lately so I stuck to Perrier and had some raw fish. Alan’s an\narchitect working for I.M. Pei. And the other kid’s a lawyer and I gave him the job of contesting our tax\nassessment because the taxes went from $400 to $12,000 when they combined both Bowery buildings together\nwhich they had no right to do, and the place is just a dump so I don’t know why it’s that high.\nThen we went for a nightcap at Trader Vic’s ($25).

Fred went up by subway to the Mitzi Newhouse Theater where Bob Wilson’s play was\nopening. Curious George. When I got to the theater Fred was there waiting with Katy Jones and her sister. The art-\nworld people were there. The play had water coming from the ceiling, clocks on the walls telling you what time it\nwas and striking. It was colored beautifully, the set’s by Bob Wilson. It took at least two hours and then it was\nover.\nThe party afterwards was at Leo Castelli’s. We were the first ones there. The food was good but Chris Makos\nsaid I looked fat, and then I looked over at Fred who never eats and stays looking so good, so I just had one\ncucumber and water, and I mixed and mingled.\nThe Knowles boy, the star of the play, sounds so normal when you talk to him, you wouldn’t know he’s autistic.\nHe answers whatever question you ask, but I guess the problem is he never says anything if you don’t ask him. I\ntalked to Jennifer Jakobson about Mr. Ballato dying. He was in his eighties. He worked at the restaurant till the last\nminute, he loved the business so much.\nFred tried to get Katy Jones to leave but she’s after Bob Wilson so she didn’t want to. We all waited for Bob\nWilson so we could go in his limo. Richard Weisman was there with Patti LuPone and she was thrilled when I\nintroduced her to Bob Wilson. She got a Tony, and she was asking me what she should do with her career and I\ntold her to hang on and stay with Evita for as long as she could because she was the only big star on Broadway and\nshe would become so huge from it. She said yes, that I was right.\nBob Wilson kept going to the bathroom a lot and coming back depressed. He dropped me and Katy. And as I\nwas getting out of the car he was saying things like, “Take hold of my hand.” And afterwards I pieced it together,\nthat when he was saying words like, “Do you think—do you think—” that he was wanting to know if I thought he\nwas using Christopher Knowles, exploiting him by starring him in plays because he’s autistic.

Right? I was\ngiving an interview to the Miami Star.\nChris Makos called from his darkroom. I want to go around town with him taking pictures. Nobody’s done\n42nd Street and the Statue of Liberty in a while.\nThen, when we were leaving the office and we’d locked the elevator and we were getting ready to leave, as I\nwas walking by the middle room the creepy kid who’d come up earlier jumped out from behind a crate. I mean,\nthat’s why I always tell Vincent to check around, because people can really hide behind things. And later Adam\nRobinson from Oxford who’d stopped by and who was still with us said that he’d seen the box move, but hadn’t\ntold me. So this kid was hiding behind the box while I was giving the interview to the Miami paper. He said it was\n“Performance Art.” I mean, I could tell he was a creep from the beginning.

Is it because there’s so many beauties now?\nA kid I know from Studio 54 called me up and at first I wasn’t going to take the call but he said he’d had a\nbreakdown in California and that I was the only one he was calling, so I did. He’s going back out to California.\nWhen I got home I was still tense from the intruder so I had a brandy. And that led to the candy drawer, and that\nled to the TV all night. I watched the Mother and Daughter Beauty Pageant on TV. And a rerun of Farrah Fawcett.\nBob Wilson’s play got terrible reviews. And I was watching a rerun of Carol Burnett and those people were just\nso good, so talented, so funny. I mean, Bob Wilson has an autistic kid and does a few imaginative things, but that’s\nall.

I think he maybe spent everything he had on\nCocaine Cowboys. I mean, if he only had a couple of million it wouldn’t’ve lasted him long the way he was living\nso high on the hog, traveling every minute.\nI glued myself and went to Mt. Sinai to visit Sandy Brant who’s expecting triplets, 101st and Fifth. Cabbed ($3)\nup Madison and it seems like they’re reclaiming some of the blocks as white. They’re putting up tall buildings and\nthe whites are slowly moving uptown. They’re selling apartments there for a couple of hundred thousand now.\nWe weren’t going to tell Sandy about the fire at their stable in Greenwich that destroyed the stable and nine\nhorses, but she told us about it. They think it might have been set. There’s a guard there twenty-four hours a day\nnow. They didn’t have a sprinkler system. We were there about forty-five minutes, till 9:00. Then worked at home.\nNo phone calls. I watched the all-day news on Ted Turner’s station.\nThe weather changed and was cool and windy and beautiful, my hair was flying all over. Fred went out to\nManhasset with the Paysons for a big house party that Averil was giving for the Fourth of July weekend at\nGreentree."

And then about 6:00 I heard fumbling at the door and it was Fred\ntrying to get his keys into the lock and it took him half an hour to make it in, and I was going to get up and tell him\noff but I was in a stupor.\nIt was raining, horrible and grey and cold, really freezing. We were going to Monte Carlo for the joint show of\nJamie Wyeth and me. Finally we got there and it was sunny and beautiful. And the first people we ran into were\nPam Combemale—her unmarried name is Woolworth—and Jamie Wyeth, they had just come in on the Concorde.\nAnd they’d lost Jamie’s clothes and Phyllis’s luggage, so she had nothing to wear.\nWent down to the lobby at 6:00 and saw the exhibition, they were putting it together. I did an interview for\nTime magazine, and then we went to this restaurant that looks just like Trader Vic’s, called Mona’s. The Portanovas\nwere there, and Liz Smith and Iris Love, and the Larsens, and there was a lot of dancing going on and Jamie was\nso great, he was dancing with Phyllis and I was drunk so I went over to them and I fell down. With them. And then\nI was dancing with everybody else—all the girls—and it was a new thing for me. I’d had two vodkas, and that\nmust have set me off.\nJamie’s so much fun because he’s a troublemaker. He’s always saying mean things about people—like he said\nthis one lady’s pockmarks made her face look like a used dartboard. He just goes right down the line tearing\neverybody apart, he’s very funny."

      "text": "We picked up Jamie and Phyllis and I apologized to Phyllis for pushing her over the night before. I told her she\nand Jamie were dancing so beautifully that I got jealous. When I started to dance with Phyllis I didn’t know that\nshe can’t go backwards so I fell on her and then Jamie fell on her, and we were all caught by somebody but it was\njust too nutty. So I apologized and we all got in the car and went out to Cap Ferrât to see Lynn Wyatt who now has\nSomerset Maugham’s old house, the Villa Mauresque that I just read about in the biography, and it was just\neverything I really wanted to see and look at. It took us a while to get there, the traffic was bad.\nLynn was wearing a dress that was split up the sides and you could see all her breasts and she just had a little\nbikini on and she looked beautiful, she has a great body. I think she was trying to get Jamie excited. And they have\nsort of the same last name. Everybody thinks it’s her son who’s having a show there.\nAnd then Sandra Hochman walked in and she was just so boring, rattling on and on, she told me she’s had a\nboyfriend who’s just bought an apartment in Monte Carlo. She said he discovered fast food—he owns Tad’s Steak\nHouses—and she told me any time I wanted to give a chic party there she’d fix it up for me.\nI asked Lynn to do an interview for Interview because David Niven and his wife came in and I told David that\nI’d just been reading all about him in the papers because he’s been suing David Merrick. He was great-looking, he\nwas so thin, and his wife was pencil-thin. And Sandra was just yapping away about all her books and she was so\npushy we couldn’t understand how she knew Lynn and it turns out she went to Bennington with her.\nDavid Niven was so cute, he told us good stories and Jamie fell in love with him. Then we had to get back to\nthe hotel because we were meeting Princess Grace at 4:00 in the lobby to show her the exhibition, it was down in\none of the dining rooms.\nWe went up to our rooms and glued ourselves together, and then we came down. Just Jamie and Phyllis and\nFreddy Woolworth and Fred were invited, Jed was still at the beach. And we had to get in line to meet Princess\nGrace. I was the first one, and we were just all making funny jokes about standing in line and finally when we\nturned around there she was, and she had a little tummy. We were supposed to kiss her hand but I refused to kiss\nher hand and so we shook hands, and she didn’t really like me, she just liked Jamie. And then when Grace found\nout that Phyllis was a big du Pont, she was really social climbing, so she was really nice. And then we had to go\nshow her the pictures, and I was trying to be funny but it just didn’t go over too well. And we chit-chatted about\nCousteau and the fish museum that’s up near her palace and Jamie said that his father knew her father, they live in\nNew Jersey now, they don’t live in Philadelphia. And we were talking about, I don’t know, just really boring\nthings, she never let her hair down. And I told her that I heard she paints, and she said she just does collages, she\nhad a big show in France that was a sell-out. And I asked her what else was she doing, and finally she told me that\nshe’s on the lecture circuit in the United States reading poetry. She does a circuit tour like Truman for a couple of\nweeks so she brings home the bucks. And finally after forty-five minutes of chitchat she decided to go. And when\nshe left she thought the security guard that has the revolver and watches the paintings for the Coe Kerr Gallery was\nFreddy Woolworth. So it was really funny, she told him she loved the show.\nFred and I had to go upstairs because I was doing a portrait. Mrs. Benedetti, who thought she looked like\nMarilyn Monroe. And I made her take off her clothes and put on white makeup. She kept posing like Marilyn with\nher mouth open and stuff and she was old, but she came out really easy, I had my contacts in and I couldn’t really\nsee but everything was fine.\nWent off to a couple of cocktail parties down at the Loews, which is a hotel that was decorated by Sharon\nHammond’s mother Mrs. Long but they have private apartments there, too. Douglas Cooper was giving a party and\nthis lady named Madame Plesch—Ettie Plesch—was giving one, too, and they’re not talking to each other so you\nhad to be careful and not say that you went to the other one.\nThen Regine invited us all down to Jimmy’z and John Larsen was there with his wife and he’s that really great\nguy, an old friend of Edie Sedgwick’s and mine from years ago, and now he’s really Jamie’s friend. He and Jamie\nare great dancers. And it was getting late and I was tired. And then Bo Polk arrived and he brought this beautiful\ngirl along with him and then Phyllis saw Jamie dancing cheek-to-cheek with the girl and she went up to them on\nthe dance floor and hit Jamie with her cane. And he got embarrassed because he was really dancing close.\nI got home and I didn’t have a key so I had to wake the chambermaid and so she put me in, it was about 3:00."

And so he was\ngoing to come up about 6:00 so I could rephotograph him.\nThen I ran into him again, on the beach, and all the people on the beach were taking pictures of him. He looked\nso great without clothes on, he’s pencil-thin, he looks like a muscle man, like Mr. America with small biceps, and I\ntold him not to ever put any more weight on again. But he was saying he had to because he had to do Rocky III and\nso I told him to do a fat suit. And so we left to go back to the hotel to refresh ourselves and wait for him to come.\nThen I glued myself together because it was time to get ready to go down to the opening of the show in the lobby. I\nwas ready before anyone else so I decided I might as well go down and work, so I got downstairs about five\nminutes after 7:00 and Pam Combemale and Freddy Woolworth were standing there greeting people and I was\nnext in line and I shook hands with everybody coming in, like a receiving line. They would introduce me and there\nwere all these old bags, I mean, the oldest people in the world. And then Jamie came down and he was next to me\nand we went down the line and in it was Raymond Loewy! The guy who designed the Lucky Strike cigarette\npackage and everything else! I was just so thrilled to meet him that I just jumped up and down and asked him if I\ncould take his picture. And he was great. And then the old bags, there were just so many of them I couldn’t believe\nit. I think we got some portraits to do so that’s great. Then Stallone came all in white, and he looked really\nbeautiful, and then Iris Love and Liz Smith came, and Liz said it was the chic-est party opening they’d ever been\nto.\nMary Richardson came and Kerry Kennedy and Mona Christiansen and a cute little girl Vicky, who’s the\ndaughter of Frank Gifford. Mona told a story of how Garbo picked her up on Madison Avenue a couple of weeks\nago and took her home for tea, but then, she said nothing happened, they just compared face jaw-lines. I don’t\nbelieve her but it was fun to hear. Mona was feeling up all the girls, really feeling them up."

Then Regine caught our eye and she ran and got drinks and shoved them all in\nour hands, and Prince Albert sat there and drank all of his drinks and just ignored us.

Everybody went swimming and we had bullshots and they were so great, and then we had\nlunch, the best fish I ever had, the best food, it was just so glamorous, breaded fish with anise, and then we had\nanise down by the swimming pool and we dished everybody.

And his wife Joanna is beautiful, she used to be a model with Norell so we\ndished the dresses and fashion and junk like that and I didn’t take any pictures, I was just too—I thought it would\nbe too much. Everybody was too scared to sit at the Johnny Carson table but David Niven sat with him and we sat\nwith Liz Smith who was sitting at the last table by the swimming pool. And then the king or prince of Yugoslavia\nsaid he had a Mao painting of mine.\nEverybody sang “Happy Birthday” to Lynn and then they had great fireworks, all the way around. A lot of\nsparkles and pink smoke and really loud firecrackers.\nThere’s so much in the papers about Ronald Reagan and it looks like he’s on his way to become president, it\ndoes look scary.

And I always\nhate to make a person wrong, so I tried to change the subject but she kept going back to it.\nThen it was 9:30 and by this time I was supposed to be at the Russian Tea Room. But then Walter Cronkite\nstarted to talk and it was so interesting. He told a Rolex story about how the Rolex guy gave him a watch and he\nwent to interview President Johnson, and all of a sudden Johnson was looking at his wrist and said, “That damn\nguy said that only presidents get that watch.” And then after that that’s all Johnson could think about and he\ncouldn’t answer any questions.\nFinally at 11:00 I was able to slip away. Because the thing was I was right up front and I just couldn’t leave\nbefore that. Outside I couldn’t get a cab so I ran all the way to the Russian Tea Room and I almost had a heart\nattack and then when I got there, the man said they’d already left, but I was glad when I heard “they,” it meant\nArma had somebody with him, probably Fred, who I’d sent because I thought I might be a little late.

Vitas was there, and Richard\nWeisman. And I just know Vitas dyes his hair and sets it in rollers, he thinks he’s losing it, the look. Then we met\nEddie Money and he was cute, he said he was rooting for me at Columbus Hospital in ‘68 when I was shot because\nhe was a cop then at the precinct right around the corner.

      "text": "It was Fred’s birthday and Richard Weisman was giving him a surprise party and the phone kept ringing all day\nand Robyn was having to invite people and not let Fred know, so the whole day was whispering.\nDropped Vincent (cab $4.50). Suzie Frankfurt said that I had to be at her house there on time, at 8:00, because\nit was a surprise party. Got there at 8:55. Every kid from the office and their date was there.\nFred came in and he was really surprised, he was shocked. John Samuels was there and he was sweet, he\ninvited me out to his father’s house on Long Island that used to belong to J.P. Morgan. John Scribner was there,\nand D.D. Ryan. And Eddie Money came with Vitas and Arma Andón. A girl came out of a cake for $500 and it was\na big dud. A big nothing—Suzie was complaining about the price. Richard paid. Averil sent a singing telegram.\nShe was there, though. She was drunk and tongue-kissing me and she got mad because I wouldn’t tongue-kiss her\nback. The two Frankfurt kids were here. I sat in the kitchen eating good kosher sandwiches.\nCurley was the real drunk of the party. Diana Vreeland didn’t come, she was too tired. Patti LuPone was there\nand her brother with his wife, he’s really good-looking. I tried to tape some of the birthday song but it was too\nnoisy. Jay Johnson and Susan were there, and Tom Cashin who’s leaving The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas this\nweek. He’s going to California to play the role out there. I got fat eating sandwiches."

If somebody had put it in a frame it could have sold for $10,000 but\nsomebody’s probably going to get it for $25.

He was really good-looking. Long hair,\n6’5\", and a face that’s a cross between Warren Beatty and Clint Eastwood. He had a bottle of wine. He was an art\nstudent, he said, out in California and he was married and had a little baby, but his wife—she was rich—she left\nhim, he said, because he needed too much time (laughs) with his own thoughts. He was making movies, directing,\nand then he said he wanted to know how it felt to be an actor, so he took acting lessons and then an agent saw him\nand he went out for a part, and they gave him the first one, the Lone Ranger. But he didn’t want to sign at first\nbecause it included all the extra things he’d have to do, like wear the costume and sing things, but then they took\nthat stuff out. He said he modeled once, that he didn’t really want to but someone had just asked him to, so he did.\nThen he was really drunk and gave me his belt. Then he started really talking, he told me that he’d been at Studio\n54 and I’d gone over and said, “You have to be careful, you’re dancing with a drag queen.” Klinton said he’s a\nfriend of Dennis Christopher’s, he fell in love with Dennis Christopher and then with that kid Bud Cort, who was\nin Harold and Maude. Then he said he’d been picked up by Halston and woke up in bed with Halston. And it was\nnutty, he was telling me all this and blowing his whole image.\nMy “This Side Up” dress went for $450 at the auction."

I can’t believe I’m so old because that means (laughs) that Brigid’s old, too.\nIt’s too abstract. I can’t even squish a roach anymore because it’s just like a life, like living. I glued myself together\nand wanted to walk. Got a lot of phone calls about my birthday. Todd Brassner called and I told him to come down\nand bring me a present, but he didn’t. Victor Hugo sent orchids with beautiful ribbons. From Renny, that must be a\nvery chic place.\nI had an appointment with Chris Makos at 860 (cab $5.50). Then the kids kept coming by. Curley brought me a\npiece of junk, an airplane light. I asked him to stay for lunch.\nRichard Weisman called to say he was coming down. I said I was going to 65 Irving for lunch, and to meet us\nthere. We went over, ten of us. Pingle—the Princess Ingeborg Schleswig-Holstein—came, who works at Interview\nnow. She’s related to Queen Elizabeth. And Brigid came. We were having piña coladas and then strawberry\ndaiquiris and then Richard had the idea to have blueberry daiquiris. It was fun.\nRupert gave me 300 ties. Robert Hayes gave me a silver set of Elvis records, every record he ever made. Mimi\nTrujillo brought two dresses to show me and Victor made her give them to me, they’re great. Then I had to go to\nthe theater. Halston sent a singing telegram that had three people singing it. They were awful. They’re trying to be\nin show business and I asked them not to exaggerate it and to sing it quietly. Halston sent a big cake in the shape of\na shoe and it must have been the best cake because Brigid ate all of it.\nI glued and was late but then Susan Johnson was even later and I screamed at her. Stephen was already inside\non the aisle when we got there. Annie was wonderful (cab $6). It was packed, you’d never think there was a\nrecession. Standing room. The audience loved it, mostly old people. I was trying to keep awake. Afterwards we\nwent backstage. I didn’t see Alice Ghostley. I went to school with her husband.\nWe got a dumpy limo outside to go to Mr. Chow’s. Mr. and Mrs. Chow greeted us. I didn’t want to sign the\nguest book there because I wanted to do it with my own pen the next time. Tina Chow wished me happy birthday.\nWe had champagne. Robin Williams came in and said hello, I asked him to join us but he said he was at the bar\nwith someone, that he’d see. With some lady friend. And then I remembered that somebody told me he met a girl\nthe day he married his wife and that they’ve been having an affair ever since. Anyway, he didn’t come back. He\nhad a short-sleeved shirt on and his arms are so hairy, that’s how Susan recognized him. I hope Popeye is a hit for\nhim because his TV show just died. Stephen invited a girl to join us for dinner, a sculptress who lives down near\nRupert. She made a sculpture out of a napkin as a present for me, but then we didn’t notice when the waiter took it\naway. Stephen was nervous and he almost started drinking. We dropped him on 57th and Second, then I dropped\nSusan (cab $5)."

      "text": "We drove out to Old Westbury with Whitney Tower to see the studio of his great-grandmother, Gertrude Vanderbilt\nWhitney, to see if Interview might want to do some shooting there (toll $1, gas $30). The house was just beautiful,\nWhitney said it was designed by William Adams Delano. She had a whole room with murals done by Maxfield\nParrish. Her sculptures were all around. Then we went next door to Whitney’s grandmother’s, Mrs. Miller, but\nshe’s in her eighties and she was “resting” so we just wandered around.\nBack to the city ($1). Stopped at Philip Johnson’s apartment, talked to David Whitney for an hour. He’s\nworking on the Jewish Museum project. He says the show should be plain, with no gimmicks. But I think it should\nbe funny, I don’t know, I think the designer can really make a show interesting. But I guess the museum has no\nmoney to spend.\nRichard Weisman had invited me to meet Ann Miller, Patti LuPone, and Phil Esposito and him at “21” for\ndinner at 11:00. At “21” they looked at my bluejeans and they were about to say something but I rushed in fast. I\nfinally talked Bob into putting Patti LuPone on the cover of Interview. She’s so funny and Bob finally fell in love\nwith her.\nAll I could do was stare at Ann Miller. Her face is flawless. Not a wrinkle, not even a smile line, and she said,\n“One of these days I’m going to have to get a facelift.” I don’t think she has, really, because her skin isn’t pulled at\nall—her face is fat but it’s unlined and not pulled. And she has tiny petite hands with long fingers. She’s been\nmarried two and a half times—one was annulled. She said, “I married the richest Texans in the world, but as soon\nas the marriages started, the romance was over.” She was cute, she ate like a Hollywood starlet on her first date—\nshe had chicken hash. That’s Hollywood style. And her nose is so fine, so perfect, it has to be a fake nose.\nAnn said that when she was at the bottom some people dropped her and now when those people send her\nflowers for Sugar Babies she writes back, “Thanks for nothing.” And the person who really did it the worst was\nBetsy Bloomingdale, Bob’s best friend. And she said that Denise Hale was “trash.” And she’s known Reagan for\nyears but said she wouldn’t vote for him. But she’s like me—after every putdown she says, “Oh but don’t get me\nwrong, Reagan’s wonderful, I just wouldn’t vote for him.”\nBob walked me home and when we got to 66th Street there was a big fire across the street from me in front of\nthe Ugandan building. A brand-new tree was burning because someone had set fire to the garbage underneath it,\nand this whole family was sitting on the steps just watching the fire burn—it looked like Puerto Rico—and I just\ngot furious—it looked like Africa—and they were just staring at this beautiful tree burning that was put in right\nwhen the one in front of my house was, and they didn’t even call the fire department! And I don’t understand\nbecause the doormen on the block must have seen it, too, and nobody was doing anything. So Bob and I went in\nand he called the fire department and they came in one second and put it out, but I don’t know if the tree will make\nit."

Went up\nto the Metropolitan Club where Ina was staying. Ina was in a black one-shoulder dress held up with a diamond pin\nthat was maybe a Halston. She had on white shoes, she was nice. Then cabbed to the Rainbow Room ($3.50). Liz\nCarpenter was there, she used to be Lady Bird’s social secretary. And she’s big and fat and Texan and she was\nwearing an American flag dress with a watermelon across the front of it. And Peter Duchin said, “I know that dress\nis patriotic … somehow.”\nIt was wall-to-wall everybody rich and famous and you couldn’t understand how they were all in town because\nit was August, and then you know it is a great city if the convention could get all this together. Tom Brokaw was\nthere and Barbara Walters with her beau, and Ina knew everybody and was introducing us to everybody but I could\nonly remember half of the names of the people I knew, so I wasn’t so good for her.\nJohn Tunney came over and put down Reagan and Bob got in a snit. John Tunney called me “Peter,” though\n(laughs), and he thanked me for doing the Kennedy poster. He thought I was Peter Max. And then it was funny\nbecause then somebody came up and said, “Oh thank you for doing the Carter poster.” Saw Art Buchwald, and Jan\nCowles was there with her husband, and Mrs. Graham we said hello to and later on goodbye to. Her daughter Lally\nwas there with Alexander Cockburn.\nIna introduced us to a girl named Dolly Fox, a rich girl who’s staying at the Ritz Towers and she’s a runner but\nshe has a pink ticket and that means she can go all the way to the president at the Sheraton. She’s in high school\nstill, but she acts like an older person. Her mother Yolanda was a Miss America in the fifties. We invited Dolly to\ndinner with us at Pearl’s.\nPearl’s was jammed with convention people. We got a table. And then Ina noticed that the Blair boy and his\nfather, Bill Blair, the ambassador to Denmark, were also having dinner and she went and invited them to join us,\nbut the boy said it was his eighteenth birthday and he’d like to have it just with his father and that they’d come\nover for coffee. Liz Carpenter was there with I.M. Pei and his wife and a woman who’s the Secretary of Education,\nShirley something, and she I think was drunk and tough and asked me my philosophy on education and I told her I\ncouldn’t even think, and she said, “You have to! Quick!”\nWe ordered dinner. Bob got screaming and crazy for a second when Ina said something against Reagan, but he\ncaught himself and apologized. Ina and Jerry Zipkin want Bob to get them invited to Richard Weisman’s lunch for\nMiz Lillian. Then the Blair kid came over and talked and he and Dolly sort of picked each other up. But Dolly is\nseventeen and acts forty and he’s eighteen and acts ten. Dinner was cheap and we even had champagne for the boy\n($125).\nThen we cabbed to Park to a party that Ina got us invited to given for the Rhode Island delegation. A lot of rich\npresidents of corporations. Alice Mason was there looking like a mammy in a turban and a red dress. She came\nover and said she was so thrilled to see me. Bob thought she was being mean, but she was nice. Everybody thinks\nCarter will win on the first ballot and then they’ll have to work really hard to get him reelected. There’s so many\nDemocrats around. They had good coffee—you can always tell if a party’s good by if the coffee’s good. This may\nhave been the kind from a restaurant that you get in a container. I don’t know.\nLeft there about 12:00, walked Ina back to the Metropolitan Club. Home around 12:30."

Robyn decided to ask around about the Holsteins and found out that they’ve got lots of titles but no money.\nWe put on a TV to watch the convention.\nI dropped the princess (cab $4.50).

I wanted to get the Blair boy for Bianca but I couldn’t remember his first name or\nhis phone number. Had a table in the back. Elaine’s a little heavier now.\nBianca waved and Nick Roeg thought she was waving at him and came over. He was drunk and obnoxious—\none of those people who scares me because they change in a second. He directed Mick in Performance. He just\nfinished Bad Timing with Art Garfunkel. He was telling Bianca that he’d loved her for years, and I said, “Why\ndon’t you use her in a movie, you can get her.” And he screamed, “How dare you, how disgraceful of you to say\nthat, what bad taste!” and Bianca was protesting, too. She was nice to him, though, she didn’t put him down. I\nguess she does hope she’ll get work from him. He was hugging and kissing her. He said he loved Bad.\nAnd then he told me he saw “my mother” on TV in England, that stupid David Bailey “documentary” about me\nwhere Lil Piccard made believe she was my mother and Nick was going on and on about how wonderful she was\nand how sweet and how great it was to have a mother who loved me so much and he wished his did and I just\ndidn’t have the heart to tell him that wasn’t my mother. He said it was so touching it had him in tears. He was\nyapping and driving us crazy. He’s fifty-two and he said how handsome he used to be and that look at him now, he\nsaid it all fell apart just recently.\nThen he and Victor had words. Victor had his Sony Sound-about on and Nick Roeg said how dare he be so rude\nand not listen to the conversation. And Victor said, listen, that it was his table and he could do whatever he wanted,\nthat Nick was his guest and how dare he complain when he’d barged in where he wasn’t invited, and so then when\nhe saw that Victor was intelligent he was hugging him and apologizing."

I sat in on it so that I’d\nhave a higher profile on the tape for the TV show. Lisa is a good interviewer.

I\ncalled Sean Young, that really pretty actress who I met with Linda Stein, because I thought that Richard Weisman\nwould like her. But she wouldn’t give me her home number so I could call her back and it’s too hard. I asked her if\nshe wanted to go to a baseball game and she said she’d been to one once already.

Jerry Zipkin was picking Bob up. So I met them at\nBob’s and we went to U.N. Plaza. There were press people outside, they took some pictures, but there weren’t any\nreally big stars. Suzie Frankfurt and Patti LuPone were there, and a 6’11” basketball player, I don’t know his name,\nhe was white, really cute, he kept trying to be friendly. Miz Lillian was in the other room. There was so much press\nand not that many people.\nA girlfriend of Robyn’s who kept asking about him was there. She has a volunteer job with LeRoy Neiman, she\ncarries his bag for him, I think. And LeRoy Neiman was there, he’s doing a drawing of Miz Lillian for the Daily\nNews. Then we went and found Miz Lillian talking to Barbara Walters. Lillian keeps saying the portrait I did of her\nraised $65,000 but I never heard a thing about that. They brought out a cake and I taped the “Happy Birthday.”\nThen LeRoy said he had a car downstairs and we could ride in it, so we all left with Miz Lillian. And it was an\nactual car, not a limo. My tape jammed and I put in another one, and it jammed, too, so then I knew it wasn’t the\ntape, that the Secret Service guy had done it. He was cute. People were looking and waving at the car, they had\nMiz Lillian balloons. She said, “Every smile is a vote.”\nAt the hotel there were sisters and brothers and cousins from Georgia. She said, “Sis!” to one but I don’t know\nif it was really her sister. We went up to the penthouse and then took another elevator to the next floor to her room,\nand she said when times were better she used to have a whole suite.\nLeRoy was drawing those terrible drawings of his, asking her questions, saying anything to her. It was great.\nHe told dirty jokes, and she told them back. Like his was one about a bear using a rabbit after every crap to wipe\nhimself, and she laughed. She’d left the liquor that Phyllis George sent at Richard’s and someone went back for it.\nPhyllis George is sending a lot of things, she wanted her husband to introduce Jimmy or something like that,\nbut Miz Lillian said it was impossible, that it was protocol. Phyllis also sent two pictures of her baby. She also sent\nMiz Lillian a sequined jacket, and Miz Lillian said, “Now how could I wear that.” I gave her a Philosophy book. I\nignored Ruth Stapleton Carter because I didn’t recognize her. There were a lot of Secret Service in the room\nbecause Carter was next door or a few doors down. I felt like a groupie.\nMiz Lillian was putting down Harvard people, she hates them, she was just on the point of calling some\nHarvard guy she was in the Peace Corps with a fairy, but she didn’t.\nI told Le Roy he was such a good interviewer that I wished he would work for Interview. He said he could talk\nso freely with Miz Lillian because she reminded him of his own mother. I left him and took a walk down the\navenue. I was signing autographs and a girl came over and handed me an “I Love New York” button, and then she\nasked me for money, and actually I was about to give her something but then she was so horrible and aggressive\nthat I handed the thing back to her and she grabbed my finger and slammed it in her book and squeezed it and I\nwas going to hit her with my tape recorder.\nI passed out Interviews and then at 4:00 had an appointment with the H&R Blocks at the office (cab $3.60). The\noffice was busy. They brought their daughter and I think a senator from Missouri. They’re from Kansas City. They\nwere thrilled with the office. I gave them a Popism. Worked till 7:30, dropped Vincent (cab $5). Had a drink and\ngot very tired, decided to stay home and watch the convention which was boring."

She could be a\nraving beauty but she doesn’t want to be, I guess, because she wears glasses and a funny hairdo.\nLiz Carpenter brought about eight people. Nancy Dickerson was there. And Wilson Kidde brought his friend\nfrom Princeton, Matt Salinger, the son of J.D. Salinger, who we’ve been trying to get for Interview but he turned us\ndown. He said it would just get too complicated to give an interview and it was just easier not to. He’s really good-\nlooking.\nAnd William Blair called and couldn’t come to lunch and said that his father didn’t want him to be in Interview\nand we can’t understand it. Lunch was for Pat Ast, and we stuck her next to the Salinger boy so she had a good\ntime. I gave a speech and I gave out Philosophy books.

Which friends? I don’t know. People he’s\nmet from work! And then on these scenes Fred is always called in, and after\nhis own night of binging then he has to act mature and be the know-it-all\nand straighten Bob out.\nAnd after weeks of Princess Holstein asking to help me I finally told her\nshe could help me trace, and then she disappeared for an hour and I had to\ndo it alone, and when she came back I asked her where she’d been and she\nsaid she had a phone call.

Mary Tyler Moore walked in right\nwhen it was starting. The show was great. Tammy Grimes was really funny\nas an old star. They had fifty tap dancers for the opening number. It was\nwhat shows should be, really big. The set changes. Gower Champion was in\nthe hospital, they said.\nThe show was really exciting, but the most amazing thing in the show\nwas that Carol Cook was finally a star! I couldn’t believe it. Here’s\nsomeone I met twenty-five years ago from Nathan Gluck and she was\nsaying every minute that she just had to be a star, had to be one. And here it\nis twenty-five years later and she’s finally made it. She had the Joan\nBlondell part. And it was the regular thing—“the show must go on” thing.\nAnd this Carol does what Brigid used to do—she looks in the mirror and\nshe’s happy because she sees a pretty face, but she never looks below her\nneck because if she did she’d see 500 pounds of fat. Desilu signed her once\nand she was in some I Love Lucys. She’s not so fat now.\nWhen the show was over there was all the bravo-ing, really a lot.\nEighty-five curtain calls. Then there was a hush. And David Merrick came\nout and put his hand to his forehead and said, “This is a tragic moment.\nGower Champion just died.” And nobody knew what to do. The lead girl\nstarted crying. She had just moved in with Gower or something. It was like\na movie, the lead guy was saying, “Pull the curtain, get the curtain down!”\nAnd outside Joshua and Nedda Logan were in tears, and it was lots of\nactors acting. Then we ran backstage and they let us in. The lead girl ran out\nand tears were coming down her face and she said something like, “Go get\nmy dress” to somebody and “The show must go on, and I have to be a star.”\nSo this was her big moment and she was so upset with Merrick for ruining\nit.\nThen we went to Carol Cook’s dressing room and Ina started to\nintroduce me and Carol said, “Oh my God! Oh my God! Andy Warhol! I\nhaven’t seen you in twenty-five years! Remember when you gave me a\ndrawing and I gave you a cat? Oh my God!” It was such a camp. “Let’s get\ntogether.”\nWe bought the papers but no reviews of the play were in it ($1). I don’t\nknow about this new section that the News is putting in that Clay Felker’s\nediting. I don’t think it’s going to make it. It looks too much like that Long\nIsland newspaper—Newsday—and I think people do like newspapers like\nthe Post more."

Picked up\nBarbara Allen and John Samuels who are now an item. We got to Diane Von\nFurstenberg’s and it was absolutely nobody we knew and Diane was\nnowhere around to introduce us, so we just sat and giggled. Then Richard\nGere and Silvinha came. They were just back from Fire Island. Marina\nSchiano and Thomas Ammann were after Richard. They were putting down\nFire Island and I said it was the greatest place in the world. I told Richard I\nbet nobody asked for his autograph because you know how cool those\nfairies are out there and Marina had to make a comment, “Well they didn’t\nask for yours but you can be sure they asked for his.” You know Marina.\nAnd Richard told Bob (laughs), “No pictures please.” Food was fried\nchicken that could have been from the Colonel’s, and chocolate cake.\nDiane’s kids are beautiful. As we were leaving she came over and said, “Oh\nmy dear, didn’t you meet the prince of Thailand?” And she pointed out this\nkid that we thought was a waiter. I mean, he could have worked at the\nvegetable stand on the corner. But she never even introduced us! And we’d\nbeen dying to meet him. He’s tinier than Rupert. Dark hair.\nLeft Barbara and Silvinha and Thomas Ammann staring at Richard\nGere. John Samuels they dropped—he was looking around nervously\nwanting to go to the Ritz to see some group like “The Coconuts” or\nsomething. Had a sleepless night."

It was fascinating\nbut I don’t know if I really could believe it. She would be great if she could\ntell you in the hour after a child was missing where he was—that would\nreally do something. She should sit by her phone.\nGlued myself together and picked up Bob and Diana Vreeland to go to\nthe Winships’ for dinner. Diana was wearing a beautiful Valentino (cab $2).\nGot there and it was really cozy, a dinner party for Zandra Rhodes. The\nCarimatis were there, and Ralph Destino and André Gregory. Ralph told me\nhe was in love and that he was going to get married and for the third day in\na row I gave somebody the lecture not to get married, which I really have to\nstop. And then I made a big bet with him and I’m scared to find out who’s\nright. A portrait-sized bet. It’s whether Rita Hayworth was born in\nBrooklyn. I said she wasn’t. I asked him for a 40 percent discount at his\nstore, Cartier. With 40 percent they still make a 10 percent profit.\nZandra Rhodes had an upsweep of purple and pink hair. The Winship\nlady had on a plain Zandra dress. Zandra’s fiancé Couri Hay came after\ndinner. He’s trying to play it heavy with Zandra so I brought up his wife.\nOh, you know, his “wife,” that boy. And he tells Zandra to be freakier and I\ntold her she should play down the freak stuff now, that the colored hair was\nsort of old-fashioned. In front of Zandra he said, when I asked him why he\ndidn’t put her in his columns, he said because nobody knew who she was."

I didn’t want to go alone so I waited on\nthe corner for Fred and Mary Richardson to pick me up and we cabbed to\n55th and Sutton Place to Le Club. The paparazzis were all there, Ron\nGalella and everybody. Caroline and John-John were there and Eunice\nShriver—I think it was her—and Ethel. The only grownups missing were\nJackie and Ted. And Jean Kennedy Smith.\nFred and I were at the old folks’ table. Eunice told me that she likes\nmadonnas and I told her that I was doing Modern Madonnas and I’m going\nto call her to come down to the office. Michael gave a speech about how he\nloved Frank Gifford and it was like having a new father. And the little ten-\nyear-old gave a speech about how when Michael was in a car and had to go\nto the bathroom he pissed in a beer bottle and they were all telling him to\nshut up but he wouldn’t. And Robert Jr. gave the best speech, he’ll probably\nbe better than Teddy, he’ll probably be the one. But the funniest Kennedy\nwas the one who was dancing with his girlfriend’s purse and being like a\nfairy. They all dance pretty good. Kerry wrote some songs and they all sang\nthem. Mary kissed all the boys, she knew them all.\nI was then invited to a boat party that Calvin Klein and Elton John were\ngiving down at that boat called the Peking where Yves St. Laurent had the\nOpium party that I’d missed so I wanted to go. Elton John had given a\nconcert for 400,000 kids in the park. Fred wanted to take Mary and Kerry\nand a bunch of boys, so we got a limo outside to go downtown. It was a\nbeautiful night. And I saw some interesting people there like Joe\nDallesandro. And Archie and Amos’s vet, who’s so good-looking, Dr.\nKritsick, was there. And John Samuels. Every model in town.

      "text": "Philadelphia—New York\nI changed my mind about the train to Philadelphia for Jamie Wyeth’s show\nat the Fine Arts Museum. Had Fred get a car. Bob and I cabbed to Doubles\n($5). We were having lunch with Jean Tailer and Pat Buckley. I checked my\nbag, had drinks, and then lunch. It was a ladies’ lunch, all the ladies like to\ngo to Doubles for lunch because it’s cheap and you can eat all you want and\ngo back all the time and it’s horrible food like smoked turkey and smoked\nham and it gave me a sore throat. All these rich ladies who spend money on\nclothes but they won’t buy good food. Bob was the best gossiper. Pat\nBuckley said she was so thrilled that Shogun was on TV. She said the night\nbefore she just went to bed with a tray and watched all three hours of it and\nhad her girlfriends call her between segments—she didn’t even go\ndownstairs to see George Bush who was having dinner with her husband.\nAnd she was so disappointed that it was only going to be on for two hours\nthat night.\nArrived in Philadelphia and couldn’t find Delancey Street, the driver\nwas too old and cranky. Saw the cracked bell. Found Walter Stait. We told\nhim that we wouldn’t be staying over after all, that we had to do a portrait\nearly in the morning in New York. Had tea, changed.\nEmlen Etting was there in a black cape and black hat, so old, looking\nlike one of those funny fairies. We gave him a lift to the museum. All the\nold bags were there. Met Jamie, did some TV. His father and mother were\nno-shows. His brother Nicky and his brother’s wife Jane who works for\nSotheby’s were there. Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn’t, and Nureyev wasn’t.\nI saw Bettie Barnes who let my cat die. It’s a man. B-E-T-T-I-E. I once gave\nhim a kitten and the kitten was crying and I thought it wanted its mother so\nI gave him the mother. We had two cats left, my mother and I had given\naway twenty-five already. This was the early sixties. And after I gave him\nthe mother he took her to be spayed and she died under the knife. My\ndarling Hester. She went to pussy heaven. And I’ve felt guilty ever since.\nThat’s how we should have started Popism. That’s when I gave up caring. I\ndon’t want to think about it. If I had had her spayed myself I just know she\nwould have lived, but he let her die.\nSo it was Jamie’s big show. I had to stand in front of my portrait. Jamie\nis painting bigger—more Pop—pictures now. I told him he should go even\nbigger and he said he didn’t think you could get stretchers that big and I\nsaid you could get them as big as the sky.\nPhyllis Wyeth was my dinner partner and my other dinner partner was\nBonny Wintersteen, she’s filthy rich.\nWarren Adelson and his wife were there and she was wearing the same\ndress she wore in Monte Carlo and I said, “That’s the same dress you were\nwearing in Monte Carlo,” and she said that when she was getting dressed to\ncome she said, “Nobody will remember this dress except Andy Warhol.\nHe’ll say, ‘That’s the same dress you wore in Monte Carlo.’ “ It was funny,\nwe had fun.\nWalter Stait was funny. I was having a good time until Fred told me that\nthis place, the Fairmont Hotel, where we went after the museum, was where\nthey had Legionnaire’s Disease and then my throat started hurting more.\nBut they said it had been completely renovated.\nThen we slipped out and went back to Walter’s to get Fred’s bag. A two-\nhour ride back. I wanted to give the driver a really big tip, but Fred said you\ncan’t spoil them ($20)."

And he’s right.\nI walked home, glued myself together. Thomas Ammann was picking\nme up to go to Sondra Gilman’s party. It was for Nick Roeg, but Nick was\ngone when we got there. It was so hot there, people were sweating. Sylvia\nMiles was there, and Sylvia acts so funny, she feels like we’ve dropped her\nand she says she wants to “renew our relationship.” But whenever she\ninvites me to be her date someplace, it’s always someplace that I’ve already\nbeen invited to, so I have to tell her that I’m already going and that I’m\ntaking somebody. And she told the best gossip—that Joe Dallesandro is\nnow living with Paul Jabara. No wonder he hasn’t been calling for money.\nSondra had some interesting people there—like Tony Walton the stage\ndesigner. Sondra looked great in this beautiful bright yellow silk dress—the\ncolor I used on the Debbie Harry portrait—and it made her look so young,\neight years old, and we asked her who made it because it was really pretty\nand she said, “You’ll fall over if I tell you.” So she told us and Bob and I\ndid fall over—it was a Diane Von Furstenberg. Off the rack for $120. It\nreally was pretty.\nSondra produced the new Nick Roeg movie, Bad Timing with Art\nGarfunkel and that girl I think I met there, Teresa Russell, she didn’t look\nlike anything. The food was awful. We left and Sondra was still serving\nquail eggs, they have a quail-egg farm."

Mrs. Winship threatened that if I didn’t let her know right then, that\nshe was going to send a car for Carolina, which I knew she wouldn’t.

I\nloved it. I just wanted a tape recorder so badly.\nFred got left for a second and when he came back Joanne saw him sit\nback down next to Mrs. Vreeland where he’d been sitting before and she\nscreamed, “How dare you sit in that spot!” Poor Fred, he’d just gotten up to\ngo to the bathroom.\nThen Ron Link who’d staged the fashion show before the dinner sat\ndown at our table and Joanne screamed at him and then he hated her and\nleft and then Joanne told Monique he’d left because of her.

Ina said she’ll probably have a heart attack. Liz Carpenter kept\nsaying, “You’ve got to Xerox me.” Instead of Polaroid. “When are you\ngoing to Xerox me, darling?”\nAnd then we went off to another party for the Dyke Women of the Year.\nYou know, the dykey types—what’s it called? “Outstanding Women.” And\nthe first person I was introduced to was this creepy guy who said that Viva\nwas in town and that he was going to be her lawyer in a lawsuit. He was\nsaying, “Viva’s very unhappy about the situations of the past,” implying\nthat she wanted to sue us, and I was saying, “Well, Viva makes her own\nproblems.

I’ll have to ask her as a Christmas present if\nshe’ll do it now, let me tape a good juicy tape so that I can use it someday. I\nwonder if I can really ask her for it—“Oh, please Paulette—just a present so\nI can (laughs) jack off by it.” That’s a good line, right? Yeah, I think I’ll tell\nher that.\nThe rain caught up with us in Manhattan. Bob had checked his bags so\nwe had to wait a little (cab $20). We all went home to drop our bags off.\n11:30.\nRon Reagan, Jr. was coming to the office. The photographers came and\nthe hairdresser came, the stylists came, the art directors came—so the place\nat six o’clock was filled with like twenty-five people. And Bob was going\naround, crazy, saying, “Is this what it is to take a simple picture of a nice-\nlooking boy?” They kept arriving—the assistants of the assistants of the\nassistants, and finally we said this is crazy and sent them away and then we\nwere down to three people, four people.\nThen Ronnie Reagan, Jr. came with his girlfriend, hand in hand. And a\nblack friend who takes care of him who he called “Chocolate Boy.” And\nJamie Kabler who’s married to Mrs. Annenberg’s daughter arranged it all.\nHe ran over to me and said, “Can you believe this? Lally Weymouth called\nRon up for an interview and when he told her, ‘I’m sorry, I don’t do\ninterviews—I’m only doing one interview and it’s for Interview magazine,’\nshe said, ‘How can you work for that homosexual publication? The two of\nus are more the same kind of person. I mean, I’ve got top family and you’ve\ngot top family, and you’re giving an exclusive to that newspaper?’ “ Jamie\nsaid Ron got really upset and wanted to call off the shoot, but Jamie ran out\nand bought an Interview and Ron read it and it didn’t look homosexual to\nhim, and he said he didn’t care anyway, that he still wanted to be in it\nbecause he wanted “to meet Andy.” And go out to dinner with me. And he\nturned out to be a really nice kid, God he was so sweet. The only trouble\nwas he kept pawing the little girl. He and the girl live together. The\nChocolate Boy is just a close friend.\nAnd he’s very smart. He didn’t say much, but then when he did it was\nsmart. Lispy and cute. And he was sort of sitting there looking bouncy.\nThen they took pictures and he drank. He drank more than anybody I know,\nI don’t know if it was just not to be nervous or what.\nThen went to do the interview at 65 Irving. I didn’t know what to talk to\nhim about, I was too shy and he was too shy. But then Bob got a little\nencouraged and started asking about his father. And I asked him (laughs) on\nBob’s behalf, whether his father dyes his hair. He said everybody asks him\nthat question. I blamed it on Bob. Bob then blamed it on me. Ron said no,\nhis father doesn’t, and that his mother’s very sweet and very adorable. So\nthen I got sneaky and brought Ordinary People up, and I told him how\nmuch I hated Mary Tyler Moore, that after I saw the movie if I saw her on\nthe street I’d just kick her. And at that point he was almost going to say\nsomething about Nancy, but then somehow he got the drift of it and\nchanged the subject. Because I think the mother in Ordinary People is just\nlike Mrs. Reagan. Really cold and shrewd. And by the way, little Timmy\nHutton, the star of it, turned us down, he won’t do any interviews.\nOkay, so we’re at 65 Irving. I told him I’d never had frogs’ legs and he\nwas so sweet he ordered them just so I could try it. He’s really sweet, a\nbeautiful body and beautiful eyes. But he just doesn’t have a pretty nose.\nIt’s too long. Big full lips. He doesn’t look like anybody in the family, it’s\nsurprising. I don’t know if he’s a fairy. He was sitting there holding his\ngirlfriend’s leg, touching her. She’s twenty-eight years old, her name is\nDoria, and they met in California. She invited me over for a Cuisinart\ndinner—he bought her a Cuisinart for her birthday. And they have a ten-\ninch television set, Quasar.\nThen outside we ran into Annie Leibovitz and she’s gotten over her\n“heart attack.” She looked great. I took some Polaroids and gave them to\nthem as souvenirs, and I gave them Philosophy books and Exposures. And\nthen little Ron wrote in one to the black friend, “To my favorite nigger,”\nand the boy said he’s going to show it around when he goes to the White\nHouse. Then we were talking about Merce Cunningham and Ron said the\npiece Merce did with the helium pillows was his favorite and I told him that\nI’d made those Silver Pillows and he said that he didn’t even know, that that\nwasn’t why he’d said it. Bob just fell in love with him, thought he was so\ngreat. Jamie Kabler had a limo and we dropped the Reagan kids off, they\nlive on 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth. They had a really good time,\nthey really liked us, so we’ll be going off to Cuisinart dinners.\nHave I said that I lost the bet to Ralph Destino about where Rita\nHayworth was born—she was born in Brooklyn and so now I have to do the\nportrait of the woman he’s going to marry."

Then John\nReinhold picked us up to see Charles Ludlam’s Ridiculous Theatrical\nCompany’s play Reverse Psychology down on Sheridan Square (cab $6,\ntickets $32).\nWe had good seats and the play was good because it was so real. It’s\nabout a man and a woman psychiatrist who have a couple of patients who\ngo off to an island and take a drug called PU which makes them love\nwhoever they didn’t, and vice versa, and it was fun, worth going to see\nbecause the fights were so real.\nJohn and I decided to go see what Bobby Short was really like so we\nwent to the Carlyle (cab $4.50) and Bobby was there singing away, and I\nwas reminiscing about seeing him in the old days when John brought me\nback to reality—he told me that Shirley Goldfarb went to heaven.

He said that at a\nparty I took a picture of him, but I must have been aiming at somebody\nbehind him. He looks like he wants to be Buck Henry. I hadn’t invited them\nfor lunch and they saw all the leftover food from the big lunch Bob had just\nhad, so I had to make some excuse, and Nelson’s so paranoid, anyway.\nRichard Weisman said he needed some girls for the “21” thing before\nthe Ali fight so I invited Barbara Allen. And she wanted to bring John\nSamuels so I asked Richard and he said yes.\nWorked till 7:30 on portraits with Rupert. I found out the fight didn’t\nstart till 11:00 so I wondered why we had to get to “21” at 7:30. I answered\nthe phones. Then cabbed uptown ($5).\n“21” was doing this special thing for its good customers, I guess, it was\ncocktails at 7:30 and dinner at 8:30. Then they gave us tickets to go over to\nRadio City Music Hall and see the fight and invited us back to “21” for a\nlight supper afterwards. John McEnroe, Sr. was there with a friend from the\nPaul Weiss office who said he was our lawyer but I didn’t know him. There\nwere Ali posters and “I Am the Greatest” buttons. I was trying not to drink\ntoo much. They kicked us out when they said we were going to miss the\nfight. We went through the Warner’s building and over to Radio City. The\nSpinks fight was on and then the Muhammad Ali fight came on and I\ncouldn’t watch it, I ate all my fingers on one side. The audience couldn’t\nbelieve it when he lost. It was too unreal. And he had makeup on, he looked\nso handsome, it was like white makeup and his face wasn’t shiny and\nHolmes’s face was black and shiny. Then we went back to “21” and I\nintroduced Barbara Allen to John Coleman. John Samuels fell in love with\nWalter Cronkite and was talking to him at the bar and I got John away\nbecause he was drunk.\nThen Richard wanted to take us to a new singles-swingles restaurant and\nhe invited three blonde girls along and Barbara didn’t like that. She was\ntalking about John Samuels, saying, “Oh look, he’s just like Peter Beard—\nhe walks like Peter, he talks like Peter, oh look, he runs like Peter, he eats\nlike Peter!” I said, “What are you talking about?” Because, I mean, they’re\nnothing alike.\nAnd Barbara was saying she couldn’t wait until Bianca came back and\nfound her with John— “What do you think Bianca will think? What will\nshe say? Well, maybe I’ll let her have him when she gets back. What will\nshe think, though?” And here John had just said to me, “I can’t wait till\nAveril gets back—I’m going to meet her at the airport.”\nBob had gotten Barbara a joint because she asked him and she was more\nthrilled with that than anything else. So we left and started to walk home,\nthis is around 79th Street, and then we heard all these cop cars and we saw a\ncrowd and John ran right up and into it and it was a dead person on the\nstreet. So we asked people and finally a doorman told us that three guys had\njust walked by and he thought they looked strange, and then they had\npicked on an undercover cop and tried to rob him and the cop had shot and\nkilled one of them. And John just wanted to be in the thick of it, and\nBarbara was upset. And it was just awful, seeing the Ali fight, and that was\nviolent, and then this, and so we got a cab and the driver seemed crazy to\nme. Barbara said he was Greek but I think he was Puerto Rican and saying\ncrazy things because he thought it was a Puerto Rican that’d got shot. So I\ndropped Barbara off and watched her go into her building and then just as\nwe were driving past Lenox Hill Hospital the body was going in that we’d\njust seen lying on the street (cab $4)!\nWhen I got home I didn’t have Barbara’s number to call her and tell her\nI got home safely, so I called Bob to get it, and he told me that Barbara had\ntold him that everyone was after John Samuels—“especially Andy”—and I\ntold him to call her up and tell her off—that if I’d wanted John Samuels I\nknew him before she did, and I’d only invited him to this thing because I\nthought it would make her happier. And that actually Richard had wanted\nanother girl, not her. So there!"

Don Munroe went off to a video conference\nin Nice. Worked till 5:30 (cab $7). Went home and glued myself and put on\nblack tie. Went to C.Z. Guest’s for drinks. A guy there told me, “We have\nsomeone in common.” He said that his family owned all the brandy and\nsherry in Spain and that in the sixties Nico was the girl in all their\nadvertisements in all the posters and subways and magazines, that she was\nfamous all over Spain. He wanted to know where this beautiful girl was\nnow and I said that it was a whole other person, that he’d never believe it,\nthat she was fat and a heroin addict. He wanted to see her and I said that if\nshe was still playing at the Squat Theater we could go see her.\nC.Z. took the station wagon and drove us to the Met to the Cardin\nfashion show dinner. It was the longest fashion show in the world. I was so\nsurprised, I think he’s kept every dress he ever made, there were so many of\nthem. I liked the show but the ladies were bored. I saw Bill Paley and\nBarbara Allen and Slim Keith. I wish I’d taken pictures, it was all the right\npeople together.\nI thought the diamonds in the eyes of Sao’s foxes were real, but she said\nthey weren’t. She asked where she could get an inexpensive ruby bracelet\nand I told her I’d seen one for $42,000. She said it was for a man and I\nguessed Patrice Calmette, because that’s who she’s been seeing, she’s\nbroken up with Naguib, she said he made her too emotional.\nBob Denison was there with his new girlfriend China Machado, and I’m\ngoing to do a million faux pas with her because I just know I’ll never\nrecognize her. Catherine Oxenberg’s mother, Princess Elisabeth of\nYugoslavia, was there. She’s beautiful, and I knew it was her from the\nmoment she opened her mouth, they talk just alike, the voice. She was\nwearing one of Carolina Herrera’s dresses. And I talked to Paloma’s mother,\nFrançoise Gilot.\nI talked orchids with C.Z. Her gardening column is syndicated in six\nnewspapers now. I had a lot of fun. We were taking São home to the\nCarlyle, we were outside getting a cab when André Oliver insisted we take\nhis limo. I saw Pierre Cardin at the end and told him his show was great—I\ndid like it because he’d kept so many dresses, from 1950-1980.\nOh and the dinner was in the Temple of Dendur room and they gave\neveryone Temple of Dendur books and chocolate truffles and I squashed\nsome truffles between the pages of a couple of the books and it looked like\nshit and São loved it. And a guy lost his book so I gave him mine and when\nhe opens it it’s going to look like shit. São had me autograph hers. We\ndropped São and then me and then Princess Polignac who does P.R. for\nCardin, and then Bob. Home around 12:30."

Well I do, but I’m not desperate.\nI turned down doing the Ronald Reagan cover for New York. The papers\nhave me down as a One-Night Republican.\nWorked on backgrounds. Rupert was back from being out looking for\nMickey Mouse pictures for the New Myths series for Ron Feldman—\nMickey Mouse, Donald Duck, the Shadow.

April Axton\nwas there with Sam Wagstaff who looked older. I accused April of being\nJewish and she said how could she be since I’ve seen her at my church, St.\nVincent Ferrer. I brought up about how April once accused me of raping her\ndog in a bathroom. The dog had followed me in and then when I came out,\nhe came out with me. She’s awful but she is funny. I told her again that\nthose photographs she gave Sam that I took of her in the sixties were now\nworth $1,000,1 rubbed it in.\nThen Carolina and I went to Carmen D’Alessio’s dinner for her forty\nfriends at Mr. Chow’s. Lester Persky was giving millions of toasts, he was\ndrunk. He toasted Henry Geldzahler who wasn’t even there. Then he forced\nme to give a toast, so my toast was, “Free drinks from Lester for\neverybody.”"

Then went to pick\nup Doc Cox on 72nd Street, he was late. Doc Cox was driving us up there\nin his Rolls. He told Brigid she couldn’t smoke in the car, that it would ruin\nthe smell of the good leather, and she started to go crazy—when she wanted\nto have a cigarette she had to lean her head out, so she was in a bad mood.\nWe got there and the Doc mixed martinis and Brigid had one, her first of\nthe day. I took pictures. Brigid ran out to pick “fresh tom-ah-toes,” but by\nthe end of the day she was drunk and they were just tom-ay-toes. I went out\nand picked plums and we were eating them—even though they did have so\nmuch bug spray on them, they were so good. I had about ten. Then I picked\ncherry tomatoes and real tomatoes. Brigid was drinking martinis out in the\ntomato patch and she lost her martini glass in the patch.\nBrigid and Charles kept talking about “lunch at Flo-Jean, lunch at Flo-\nJean,” and saying, “You’ve never seen anything like it in your life.” And the\nmore they kept saying that, the more you just wanted to hate it. But we got\nthere and, well, you’ve never seen anything like it in your life. It’s the\nsickest restaurant I think I’ve ever been to. A big rambling restaurant run by\nFlo and Jean and filled with baby dolls, a million of them. All colors.\nBecause the place is very colorful. Napkins that’re pink and green and\nyellow—just really a lot of color. Either Flo or Jean said her husband died\nin 1929. The food was the worst, but there was a lot of it. I gained four\npounds and all I had was mashed potatoes and sweet relish. We had a lot of\ndrinks there, Brigid went on with her martinis. Charles paid for the lunch\nbut I bought souvenirs. Everybody had a good time. This restaurant had\nrooms and rooms that just went on and on, and they have weddings and\nparties there. It took up like a fourth of the Delaware River.\nBrigid was drunk, she kissed all the waitresses. Then she began telling\nme food stories she’d never told before, like how she once went to the\nOyster Bar in Grand Central Station and ordered a three-pound lobster and\na nice waitress brought it to her but it didn’t look like three pounds to\nBrigid. Brigid said, “I am a compulsive eater and I know my food and this\nis not a three-pound lobster.” This lobster was costing like $39. The\nwaitress said, “Oh, I’m sure it is.” So Brigid said, “Then let’s go weigh it,\nand if this lobster is three pounds I’ll give you $10.” So they went into the\nkitchen and put it on a scale and it weighed less than one pound! So the\nwaitress was really embarrassed and said they wouldn’t charge her.\nBrigid was by now wacko, drunk, really drunk. I watched TV on\nCharles’s Betamax. Charles has porno movies but they’re all straight porno\nmovies like the Debbie Dallas one. He only likes straight porno because he\n(laughs) only likes straight guys. So I watched those.\nWe’d finished lunch at 5:30 but Charles was taking us to dinner at 6:00.\nOh, and it turned out Brigid made out with the farmhand down the road\nonce when she visited Charles. Charles said to her, “Did you fuck the\nfarmboy down the road? He’s been acting different with me ever since you\nwere here.” And she confessed that she had. It was one afternoon when she\nwas alone and only 125 pounds. She decided she wanted some crème\nfraîche and that she’d go right to the cows. So she walked and walked and\nshe came upon a farmhand. And now this farmhand acts funny with Charles\nbecause he thinks it was Charles’s wife or girlfriend that he fucked.\nAnd a hustler came by who only charges $30 because it’s just a small\ntown. It’s really a gay Peyton Place.\nDoc Cox drove us back and dropped us off."

He could actually be a good song-and-dance man, probably, like that\nblond guy who was popular during the war, you know, Van Johnson.\nIt was raining out. A girl from the Reagan committee came over to Bob\nand said she’d been calling him all day, that his interview with Patti Davis,\nthe Reagan daughter, could happen tomorrow, so Bob was thrilled. Patti’s\nthe one who lived with the Eagles. Then she came over herself and she was\ntall and sort of pretty, I thought, but she was wearing funny clothes, a\nsweater and something. Vincent videotaped her. I said to her that when we\ndid the actual interview, maybe she could wear some fancy clothes, and she\nsaid, “These are my fancy clothes.” I said. “Well then maybe you could\nwear something with a good label in them.” And she said, “No I’ll probably\ncome even more casual to be interviewed.” So I gave up and said, “Oh\nforget it.” So she looked sort of pretty to me, but then looking at her later on\nthe video, how could these kids have missed their parents’ good looks?

Bob was working on the Ten Straight Men For São dinner\nthat he’d promised her, still trying to find some straight guys. Every straight\nman cancelled. I guess they won’t come out with us without Richard\nWeisman and the athletes. Dropped Rupert (cab $6.50).\nBob was ringing the doorbell, he had a limo with São. We went to\nHélène Rochas and Kim D’Estainville’s at the Olympic Tower for a drink.\nIt was windy. São had just had her hair done and she said that she would\nnever live there because when you walk in the door the draft is so strong\nthat your hairstyle always goes. She said she knew a couple of women\nwho’ve moved out because of that. So before she went in, we had to go in\nand have the guy close the inner door and that got rid of the wind and then\nshe came in.\nThen we went to dinner at 65 Irving. We picked up Franco Rossellini on\nthe corner in our limo. We yelled, “Mary!” and he didn’t hear us, and then,\n“Porno Queen!” and he still didn’t hear us and he was wearing a cape and\nfinally he saw us. He’d told Bob earlier in the day that he was retiring from\nthe movie business because he’d made so much money on Caligula."

Rupert was the makeup person. She’s light, her hair was in pigtails\nand she took them out and it went down to her ass, she’d just washed it and\nit smelled good. We had lunch. She’s going to school. She was a science\nmajor but she wasn’t smart enough and now she wants to do social sciences\nand I told her oh no. Bill looks great. The only thing we’re still worried\nabout is that she did fire all the people who worked for him. She didn’t\nseem pushy or tough like I expected, though. She just did whatever I asked\nher to. She was nice.\nJed bought the apartment right across the hall from Stuart Pivar’s in the\nbuilding on West 67th Street next to the Café des Artistes. He’s going to use\nit as an office for his decorating business so his clients and all the workmen\nwon’t be tramping in and out of the house all day anymore, so that’ll be a\nrelief.\nI called Jane Holzer. I said I’d pick her up for the Diane Von Furstenberg\nparty for Diana Vreeland. Worked till 8:00, then cabbed ($5.50) to pick Jane\nup at the Volney on 74th and Madison where she’s got the penthouse with\nRusty now. Jane’s apartment is small but nice. Rusty answered the door and\nhe’s put on weight because I guess he spent the summer with his father,\nLenny, but he’s so charming. It’s like listening to Cary Grant. He says,\n“Love to you, Mommy.” Jane’s now in investing and real estate and movies.\nSo then cabbed to DVF’s ($3). As soon as we got to the building Warren\nBeatty walked in behind us, but when he saw us he went outside again, he\ndidn’t want to go into the same elevator. I told Jane he’d come in and then\ngone out again and she said that if he’d seen her he wouldn’t have done\nthat. Right after we got upstairs Warren came in and he kissed Jane and I\ntold him, “Oh Warren, you’re so mean, you wouldn’t ride up with us,” and\nhe said he was looking for someone he was supposed to meet downstairs.\nBut he didn’t come in with anyone, so … He looked sexy but a little older\nand a little puffier—his hair’s that Hollywood way, you know, that looks\nlike a hat? Richard Gere was there and I introduced him to Jane and he said,\n“Oh Baby Jane, you’re a legend. I read about you in Popism.” Apollonia\nwas there and ‘man and a beautiful young girl named Diane Lane—I don’t\nknow if she was with Lou Adler or not."

Rupert took\nsome Interviews and we went down to the Village. People seemed out\nshopping early. I think this is going to be the most gigantic Christmas for\nsales, I really do. Country-wide.\nRon and Doria were already at Nippon when we got there. The owner\ntook us to one of the private rooms. Ron was in his alligator T-shirt to show\noff his muscles. The Secret Service jammed the place. The owner kept\nbringing in toys for us—he gave the Reagans this new kind of bottle-opener\ngun that opens up and you really could kill somebody with it. Bob asked if\nwe could go to the inauguration in January and they said we’d be getting\ninvitations. They said they were going to Bermuda soon, and Bob said he\nwas seeing Lily Auchincloss so he’d ask if it was okay for them to stay at\nher house there. Doria’s really sweet and charming. Bob was so happy. We\nleft them with the Secret Service and got home—walked—about 12:30 or\n1:00 (dinner $200).

And telling me all about it and being really\nnice.\nMeanwhile Curley was getting really drunk and I knew I had to get him\nout of there soon when he started calling Mick “Michael” and taking\npictures. Curley still believes my father died in the Pittsburgh coal mines\nand because his mother’s family, the Mêlions, own Pittsburgh, he feels\nguilty, so that’s funny. So I got Curley out of there and I thought I could\nsober him up a little if I took him to the Brasserie. He’s drinking so much\nthese days, and it’s still fun, but if he keeps it up, it’s like it’s going to turn.\nAt the Brasserie I ordered just everything ($50). Then Curley started crying\nand I said he had to stop so then he was good and started laughing and\nstaggering again. He dropped me, and it was still only 1:30 and still\nfreezing."

We had binoculars. I focused on\nRosalynn, she looked so sad.\nSenator Pell gave Ina a seat on the president’s platform for the swearing-\nin.\nDuring the swearing-in a Marine stopped in front of each row and said\nin a low voice, “The hostages have just left Tehran, in case you haven’t\nheard.” And there were helicopters everywhere just patroling the sky. And\nthey had bulletproof glass all around the podium.\nAfterwards in the Capitol building by a staircase that said “Senators\nOnly,” we ran into Doria and Ron, so we had all these big helios. And then\nthey got whisked away and we went down another hall and suddenly there\nwas a voice saying, “Andy! Andy!” and it was Happy Rockefeller and she\nsaid, “Andy, why don’t you ever come and see those paintings you did of\nme?” She was in a mink coat. The place was practically empty by then and\nshe had a Marine with a walkie-talkie next to her.

I asked one of them if he wanted to meet\nMary Tyler Moore and ask a few questions. This cop was really cute, he\nsaid he used to sing with a group called something like the Passions in the\nsixties or fifties, and that they had a few hits. He asked her if she wanted to\nride on a horse outside and she said yes, that she wanted to right then, but\nthen he got nervous that something might happen to her, so he gave her an\nhonorary police card instead. They were flirting.\nMary’s studying political science and, I mean, with that voice, she could\nreally be the biggest thing in politics since Ronnie Reagan. She goes to a\npsychiatrist two or three times a week. And then she got a craving for a hot\nfudge sundae so I said Serendipity was the best really good place and she\nliked the idea of that.\nWhen we walked into Serendipity the whole place hushed—“There’s\nMary.” We sat under the lamp that was in my living room thirty-five years\nago. I ordered half a sundae and so did Mary and Ara.\nAnd she’s so “assured of herself” it’s funny. Do you know what I mean?\nIt’s almost comical."

The streets were mobbed\nwith TV crews and police.\nChurches always make me dizzy. They had pretty flowers on all the\npews. The bridesmaids came in, and the funny thing with that was that\nwhen Bob was in Switzerland they were making up all the bridesmaids’\ngowns there and they were saying, “These are for the Kennedy wedding,\nthey’ve ordered all these nightgowns.” So here were all these girls in what I\nknew were nightgowns that cost probably $75 each. Purple with pink ballet\nshoes. Kerry Kennedy was a bridesmaid and Mary Richardson’s sister. And\nthen the bride came in and she was the prettiest bride I’ve ever seen in my\nlife. Really the best-looking bride. It made you want to get married, it really\ndid. I’d met her before, in Monte Carlo. She’s Frank Gifford’s daughter.\nCab to the St. Regis where the reception was on the roof ($4). It was\nbeautiful up there. I had to shake hands again. Robert Kennedy wanted to\ntrade ties with me, and then he was peculiar, he wanted to trade pants. He’s\nthe other good-looking one, he was going with Rebecca Fraser. Really,\nthese kids were all so good-looking, just a roomful of seventy-five of the\nbest-looking boys and seventy-five of the best-looking girls, and then about\ntwenty older people. Caroline Kennedy wouldn’t talk to me, she was giving\nme the cold shoulder, I don’t know why. But John-John was nice, he said hi\nand everything.\nI went quickly through the receiving line. Senator Kennedy was so\nsweet to me and thanked me again for doing the posters for him. He and\nJoan were together at this thing.\nI was invited to Stephen Graham’s and then Franco Rossellini called and\ninvited me to dinner at Le Cirque and we knew that President Reagan was\nhaving dinner there, too.\nWalked over there and we got the worst seats, we couldn’t see anything,\nso Franco took the best seats and he started describing to us every little\nthing the presidential party was doing. All of the tables had reporters having\ndinner to cover the president. The whole place was foreigners, Bob and I\nwere about the only Americans.\nThen we were leaving and didn’t want to go by the president’s table\nbecause it was too groupieish—everybody else was stopping at the table—\nso we went the other way, but then they called us over, Jerry Zipkin was\nyelling, and I met Mrs. Reagan, and she said, “Oh you’re so good to my\nkids.”\nThen went to go to Stephen Graham’s, to the Sovereign. A boy asked me\nto go home with him and I didn’t know what to do because nobody had ever\nasked me that. I mean, in those words (cab $5). Bed. Then Chris Makos\ncalled. I knew he was calling from the Baths, and then he admitted it."

Oh, and Jon\ntold me the other night that he liked Popism, but to Chris he said he didn’t\nthink Paramount could do it. But maybe eventually something will happen\nwith it. Maybe it’s too soon. Oh, and Jon said to me that he thought it was\n“badly edited” so I don’t know if he’s good at reading.\nI got cake and tea together. Jon brought his dirty laundry to wash while\nthey visited because at first Jon said he couldn’t come over, that he had to\ndo his laundry in a laundromat on Columbus Avenue and I told him I had a\nnice clean machine at my house. I want him to feel at home here.\nJanet Villella called and said she was sending a car to the ballet.\nWe arrived at the Met. It was star-studded. It was a benefit for the\nJoffrey and the ballet was absolutely boring. It was just intricate sexy\ndances. Got drinks at intermission ($20). Ron Reagan, Jr. was in the first\npart, but he didn’t have much to do—he was the last boy in the last row\nwith the last girl—but he dances a lot better, he’s improved so much. And\nthen in the second part he was sitting in the presidential box with his mother\nand father, and he and Doria were waving.

She said she gave a lecture at UCLA.\nBob was frazzled because he said that when you give a lunch that big\nyou don’t really accomplish anything, that nobody knows why they’re\nthere, whereas if you have it a small lunch, they know they’re there to be\ntalked into buying ads. Mary Boone didn’t know why she was there, he\nsaid.\nAnna Wintour who used to work on Viva who got Catherine her job\nthere came up to show Bob an idea for an Interview fashion insert that she’d\nworked on for three months because she thought it was a good idea, and he\njust looked at if for one second and said it was trash and she started crying.\nAnd she’s such a tough cookie that I could never even imagine her crying,\nbut I guess it was her femininity coming out.\nLater we had to go to Bolero, the new club which advertises, so we went\nand it was so strange. It’s like a brownstone and you go in and they put you\nin an elevator, and the doors close and it shakes you around and the lights\ngo, and then the doors open and you’re really on the same floor, on the\nother side! I guess they really wanted you to think you’d gone someplace.\nIt’s like a fake townhouse—paneled walls and a couple of candelabra.\nAnd the ladies there said, “This area is sealed tight, and I think you\nknow what that means— that means you can do anything in here, anything\nyou want.” It’s such a camp."

Chris said Fred’s just jealous.\nSo we got to the museum and it was an unbelievable crush, open to the\npublic, and I’d never been in Vienna before so this was “See Andy now or\nyou’ll never see him again.” And that lasted for two hours, and I had to sign\nshoes and asses, and I didn’t even look up once.\nThen finally Christopher couldn’t stand it anymore and said that we had\nto leave, so we ran out past all the TV people and jumped into the car and it\ntook us to a Viennese restaurant where we had hot dogs. Then to a great\nclub called Chaca—all young, good-looking kids. Tangos and old Elvis\nsongs and it was just the greatest.\nChris and I took this adorable boy, Martin, back to the hotel. We got him\nto take his shirt off and then we got him to take his pants off, too, and he\nhad the craziest sort of Op Art underwear on and we took pictures and he\ndid the best poses and then we gave him the car to go home in. One thing\nI’ve learned from Chris is that if you tell anybody to do anything, they just\ndo it. Especially models and actors. And then I saw a Telex from Jon Gould,\nhe’s back in New York, and it was a really nice note and then I felt great."

Chris is just the perfect companion for me.\nHe’s everything I’ve ever wanted. He’s pushy but then he’s not pushy. And\nhe’s a child. And he goes off to sex parties and comes back satisfied with\nhis pipes cleaned, and he’s so in love with his lover, Peter, he’s really\nconsiderate, and when he goes places he can’t wait to leave—just like me—\nand he gets me to go running all over and even though he’s now got me\ncarrying his knapsack, I don’t mind because it’s all exciting and he makes\nme feel young. I’ve offered Chris a reward—this wristwatch he wants—if\nhe can get Jon Gould to fall for me. It’s confusing because Jon tries to keep\na straight image, he tells me he’s not gay, that he can’t … but I mean …\nTook the Concorde, got home at 9 A.M. on the dot. I called Jon Gould\nand he said he couldn’t talk, his tub was overflowing.\nCabbed ($4) downtown. Talked to Marc Balet, he was at the office, he\ndesigned the Zoli agency book that I’m in—the catalogue of their models. I\nalready got some job offers, I’m officially a male model now.\nDoria Reagan came to work. And then I looked out the window and I\nsaw Ron walking along the street alone and he was wearing bright red, and\nI mean, if I could pick him out from the window … And Doria knew where\neverything was, she said, “There’s three Secret Service in the front and four\nin the back.” They walked up the stairs because the elevator was broken.\nAnd then I wanted to see Barbara Stanwyck that night at Lincoln Center,\nshe was getting the Film Society annual award, and so I called Sue Salter\nthe publicist and she was just rotten. She said, “Oh my dear, they’re all sold\nout,” and I told her, you know, “We’ve really done so much for you,” and\nshe said she would try to find one ticket, but that I would have to pay, and\nthat she could get me two tickets but that they would cost $250, so I said,\n“That’ll be just fine.” At least now they can’t ask me for any more favors.\nMaybe the best thing to do is always pay, and then they can’t ask you for a\nthing. But last year they gave me free tickets.\nJon Gould asked me to pick him up so Chris Makos and I did. We\nwalked over to Alice Tully Hall and there were a lot of empty seats so I was\nreally hating Sue Salter down to my toes. But at least the seats were good,\nrow J. And the Barbara Stanwyck clips were great, although at the end it got\nboring because they used the same ones too much. At 11:30 Chris dropped\nme off."

Fred is still furious, he said I should be getting thousands for\nendorsing products, not working for modeling fees. But I think it’s funny to\nbe just another pretty face in the Zoli book. I told him to lighten up."

You do this and what does it mean, and you do\nthat and what does it mean?\nReally I’m in a strange period, I put off telling the Diary about my\nemotional problems because last Christmas when I was having all the fights\nwith Jed and he moved out, I couldn’t face talking about it, and now I’m\nliving alone and in a way I’m relieved, but then I don’t want to be by\nmyself in this big house with just Nena and Aurora and Archie and Amos.\nI’ve got these desperate feelings that nothing means anything. And then I\ndecide that I should try to fall in love, and that’s what I’m doing now with\nJon Gould, but then it’s just too hard. I mean, you think about a person\nconstantly and it’s just a fantasy, it’s not real, and then it gets so involved,\nyou have to see them all the time and then it winds up that it’s just a job like\neverything else, so I don’t know. But Jon is a good person to be in love with\nbecause he has his own career, and I can develop movie ideas with him, you\nknow? And maybe he can even convince Paramount to advertise in\nInterview, too. Right? So my crush on him will be good for business.\nOh, and the most interesting thing was seeing Lou Reed on the street in\nthe Village with his wife. She’s nothing special, just a little sexy girl. I told\nhim that I’d just been reading about him in People and I asked him why he\ndoesn’t come over and see us, and he said it’s because he doesn’t know any\nof the people anymore, and then he asked if Ronnie was still around, and I\nsaid yes, and then if Vincent was still around, and I said yes, and if PH was\nstill around, and I said yes, so it was funny. Went home.\nI cooked an early Easter dinner and it smelled like the old days when PH\nused to come up and cook me cabbage with caraway seeds and onions. Jon\nwas a little late because he had to go to Macy’s to return some sheets. He\nbrought me an Easter basket, it was kind of plain. I gave him a tour of the\nwhole house to impress him, and I was hinting like crazy that it could all be\nhis, that there was a room with his name on it.\nThen we went to see Excalibur. The sex scenes were a little corny but\nbeautifully done. He had his armor on when they were having sex. And then\nthe focus was so soft. And I was so confused, I always thought Camelot was\na real place. So after the movie we walked back home. I’d given Jon a\nrabbit puppet and he was waving at people with it. He’s going to his\nfamily’s house in Massachusetts for Easter."

She has gallstones\nthe size of grapenuts. She said they want to operate. I told her that they\nalways want to operate, that it’s like doing portraits, you don’t care who you\ndo as long as you have someone to do. Because that’s where they make\ntheir bucks. I told her to ask the doctor for painkilling stuff but she said she\nalready did and they wouldn’t give it to her, they said they needed to know\nif she had pain so when she started having it they could give her the\noperation. I think she should get it in September unless it’s really hurting\nher. Life is just too hard. Called Rupert.\nThen I got the book of my old paintings out and saw all the clever things\nI used to do, and I just can’t think of anything clever to do now. Maybe I\nshould do Soup Cans again. Then Chris Makos called and said Schnabel\nwas big, that abstract expressionism was coming back. And he said that he\nwould bring a can over for me—Campbell’s Won Ton soup that has the\noriental lettering.\nCalled Jon and nobody answered. Saw a wonderful movie on TV, Coal\nMiner’s Daughter, and I wished I taped it. Oh, I wish I was married to a\nhusband like that! Oh, he’s so cute, so wonderful."

Then Steve—oh God,\nhe knows everything and he remembers just what you don’t want him to.\nHe looked at Jon and said to me, “What did you say his name was? What’s\nthat name? Isn’t he the one you told me thought that Popistn was badly\nedited?” And I said, “Ohhh, please, Steve, not now.” And the thing I can’t\nunderstand is why I would have told Steve that and even said Jon’s name to\nhim. That’s fascinating. Why would I do that? Why would I beg for trouble?\nAnd when Steve heard that Fran was going to be on the cover of\nInterview he said that he wanted to be on the cover, too, when his book\nHype came out. So then he was going on about how he had checked into\nJon—into exactly what his job was at Paramount—and how he was a “vice-\npresident in charge of inter-office memos” and finally I told him that if he\ndidn’t shut up I wouldn’t put him on the cover. So then he said he just\ninterviewed Roy Cohn and that he was going to ask him, “Aren’t you a big\nfag?” but then he ended up liking him and he didn’t, so he still had the\nleftover question and he asked me if I’dlike to admit that I was."

I met\nIris’s sister who has blonde hair now, she had a crush on me twenty years\nago, and now she’s divorced twice.\nIt started to rain and they kicked us out of the garden.

And it was just like talking\nin a movie, talking to Jack on the phone. It was so exciting. God, it was\nexciting.\nThen John Denver was coming over for dinner and we’d read all the\ngossip papers—The Globe, The Star, The Enquirer, five of them—and we’d\nread everything about John Denver going back to his wife and all of a\nsudden the doorbell rang and there they were and we said we knew all\nabout them, that they didn’t have to talk. And they thought it was funny.\nAnd they were adorable. I got drunk on champagne and later Fred accused\nme of name-dropping every second. John Denver said he was going to take\nme up on his private little airplane, he said he would fly us the next day to\nwhere we were going—Fort Collins. He said that he knew all about me and\nthat people always tell him he looks like me.\nMonday, August 31, 1981, Colorado\nWe called up Jack and he said he’d meet us in Aspen so we drove all the\nway to Aspen and it was just so beautiful and a toy town.\nWe went to this restaurant where Jack met us with Lou Adler, and Jack\nwas just adorable. God, he just was adorable. The waitresses were adorable,\neverybody was adorable. Bob complained later that Christopher was so\npushy, but I told him it’s good to be pushy because it’s the only way to get a\ngood picture, and not to worry about it.\nI told Jack I loved Body Heat. Because he’s out here in the sticks and so\nhe doesn’t see anything. I said it was a real hot movie. He kept asking about\nthe girl, Kathleen Turner, and I said that she’d never be remembered. He\nsaid she was no Jessica Lange, which she really isn’t. Then we said\ngoodbye to him and went back to the car.\nWe drove to the airport to John Denver’s plane but the weather was bad.\nThen all of a sudden John Denver’s father appeared. So we got in this Lear\njet and his father flew it and we went up and down and up and down and we\narrived in Fort Collins and were met by all these kids and were taken to the\nmotel.\nWe bought a lot of Rolling Stones with Jim Morrison on the cover. He’s\nliterally selling more records dead than alive.\nHad dinner with the president of Colorado State University whose name\nis Chris Christoffersen, spelled with Cs. After dinner he took us to the\nmuseum so we could see the show before anybody else did. In front of the\nmuseum they have three cans that are about thirty feet high and they look\nlike big sculptures by Oldenburg, big handpainted Campbell’s Tomato Soup\nCans. One of the kids did them, I guess. And every room here at the motel\nis cans with flowers in them, and I mean, I’m so tired of the Campbell’s\nSoup Can I could throw up. But the show’s cute, it’s just in one room and\nit’s all prints, and we stayed there about an hour then I got back and I took a\nValium and I couldn’t sleep."

They said that when Rauschenberg was there nobody\nwould come and that I’m the most famous artist in the world.\nAt the opening, we had to go into the show the back way. All these kids\npushing and shoving and I had to sit there. All I do is sign sign sign.\nAnd the biggest shock was two hours later this girl comes up and says,\n“Hi, it’s Eva, your niece.” And I didn’t know what to do with her. This is\nEva who lived in my house on 89th and Lex for a few months in ‘69 or ‘70,\ntaking care of my mother. She said, “I’ve been waiting two and a half hours\nin line.” And I knew I was in Denver where my nephew ex-Father Paul is\nand I didn’t call him, either. Eva just read it in the paper. I can’t face a\nfamily, I guess.\nI was signing signing signing and then a guy came with a big fat yellow\nsnake around his neck. He was so creepy, and he said, “Sign my snake,”\nand Christopher freaked out and said, “No snakes! No snakes to be signed!”\nSo he said, “Sign my forehead.” So here’s this snake coming at me. So I put\nan “X” on his forehead. Because I couldn’t write, I was just too nervous\nwith the snake. We had to go through another whole hour ordeal. It looked\nlike it would never be the end, but finally it was the end. So I guess there’s\nalways an end."

And they brought the biggest bulls with flies on them\nthat you could ever imagine. They had this poor little animal—he had his\nhead stuck in a thing—and the guy said, “This is a steer, and when he was\nyoung, other male steers would jump on him, he’s just one of these strange\nanimals that give off the wrong hormones.” And so as soon as they saw that\nhappening they pulled him out and segregated him, and now he’s being\nused in this experiment to get fucked by a big bull. And there was a big bull\nsitting there, waiting.\nChristopher ran out of film and he was going nuts, he wanted to get the\nbig cock out. So they get the bull over and let him mount the steer and he\ngives out some juice but they don’t want that juice. His cock is like a two-\nfoot pencil. It’s pointed. So the guy said, “Wait, I have to get the artificial\nvagina.” So he ran in and got the glove and everything, and then the bull\nmounted again and he ejaculated really fast and the whole thing was over.\nThen we went into the office and watched while the guy took the sperm out\nof the artificial vagina.\nAll of us slept on the way to the airport for some reason except Chris, he\nsaid he was going to spend the night in Denver and go to the Baths.\nWatching the bull must have got him really hot.\nGot to New York, our driver was waiting for us. Dropped Fred off and\nhe gave me my underwear which was in his bag, then dropped Bob off.\nTipped the driver ($40).\nBob had the best news because he got the job he tried out for on the new\nParamount TV show, Entertainment Tonight.

So then Halston asked Steve to\nchoose between him and Calvin—Steve chose Calvin. But then Calvin\nsmoothed things over by calling Halston to invite him. Went in Halston’s\ncar and arrived to the Sovereign and went up to Calvin’s penthouse and\neverybody was either famous or beautiful—Brooke Shields and seventy-\nfive other models, and Jack Nicholson was there.\nAnd Godunov was there, he came over and he looked so beautiful and\nsexy and he’s just changed his whole personality, he’s so free and talkative\nnow. Then we went to Studio 54 and the street was just mobbed like I’ve\nnever seen it, and it made my art opening look like it’d been deserted. And\nCalvin took Brooke. It was so jammed they must have made a fortune at\n$25 a head. Went to leave at quarter to 3:00. It took us fifteen minutes to get\nout of the place.\nOh, and I forgot to say that Truman called on Monday and his voice—I\ndidn’t even know it was him on the phone. He was saying cuckoo things,\nlike that he’d died twice and that his brain had stopped for thirty-two\nseconds so that’s what he was going to call his next book—Thirty-two\nSeconds. Then the next day, Tuesday, at about 6:30, he collapsed in his\nlobby and all the newspapers and TV reporters rushed over to U.N. Plaza.\nHe was taken to the hospital and it was front-page news, it got the cover of\nthe Post and everything, and so I think he must have gotten the press that\nwe were supposed to get at the Feldman Gallery.

I got cleaned up and dressed and we went to Mr. Black’s office.\nIt was a post-modern building, the kind with the big columns, and there was\nan old-fashioned lady with her hair up at an old-fashioned switchboard.\nMr. Black had read Popism the night before, he’d done his homework,\nand he reminded me of Peter Brant, but nicer. He was about thirty-seven,\nand sort of heavy, very nice, and a nice fortune—they have mines and\nsupermarkets and newspapers.\nThen I dressed for a dinner Mr. Black and his wife Lisa were giving for\nme, at the museum. And Gaetana Enders’s husband, Tom, who’s the Under-\nsecretary of State for Latin American Affairs was going to be there with\nGaetana—he used to be the ambassador to Canada, and he’s 6’6” and\nGaetana’s 4’4”.\nI called the office in New York and I got mad because I was trying to get\nJon invited to T.T.

They\nhad a little TV crew there, and we were putting down publicity until we\nfound out that Mr. Black owns the TV station. And they had a cardinal\nthere, who’s just had a stroke so half of him was there, only, and Mr. Black\nhad him saying grace. Bob was having a good time at this, finally. He’s\nbeen so grouchy lately but the room full of billionaires perked him up.\nSo we’re at the dinner and they introduced me to the cardinal and he\nsaid, “I hear you have a nephew who’s a priest,” and I said, “Oh yes, but he\njust ran away with a Mexican nun.” And when I said that, Fred yanked me\naway and was screaming at me how could I do that to the cardinal when he\nwas half-gone and there were only twenty cardinals in the world, and why\ncouldn’t I have just said, “Fine,” and let it go, and the cardinal could hear\nFred yelling at me and then they took him away and put him in a car, and he\nrolled down the window and said, “Andy Warhol is such an honest person,\nhe could have lied to me and said his nephew was fine but instead he told\nme the truth and I love his art and I know he goes to church every Sunday.”\nAnd then I was given a tour of the Gauguin to Moore exhibition. Henry\nMoore gave this museum all these plastic things, nobody knows why he\ngave them so much. Really impressive. Like forty figures, gigantic. I mean,\nmy work looks like nothing compared to that stuff. Oh, I’m getting to hate\nmy—I must be—all I do is tour, everybody else works. I have to get back\nand do something.

Leo called and asked when I was coming down, he wanted to show\nme a photograph of me by Hans Namuth, which did turn out to be beautiful.\nI hated the show. And Ethel Scull said, “Do you remember me?”\n(laughs)\nAnd Lester Persky invited me to his cocktail party before the king of\nSweden party, but I couldn’t go because the only way I could get Jon to\ncome to the king of Sweden dinner was by first taking him to Giorgio\nSant’Angelo’s surprise party for Marina Schiano.\nOh, and I’m forgetting the most glamorous thing of my opening. Warren\nBeatty walked in with Diane Keaton and I made a faux pas by saying, “I\njust read that article about you in Playgirl,” and they said, “Oh my God!”\nand ran out. I don’t know if they were interested in buying art or if Diane\nKeaton wanted to take pictures, but anyway they made quite an effort to\ncome to this crowded thing, so that was nice.\nSo later at Reginette’s I really liked dinner, it was fun. The cute girl next\nto Jon was an Argentinian, a Ford model, and she was cute because she ate\nthe bread that I’d autographed. And (laughs) the king of Sweden was there.\nBob said that a few months ago Diana Ross’s P.R. guy wouldn’t say if she\nwould come or not to this dinner, that he (laughs) asked Bob, “Well who\nelse is going to be there besides you, Andy, and the king of Sweden?”\nI got home and went to bed and the alarm went off at 3:30 and I was\nscared and Aurora was there and we went around the house together\nholding hands and it was a false alarm, we didn’t find the bogeyman."

Massimo Gargia, the man who started The Best, said that\nsince I was so late to accept, mine was the only blank award, it didn’t have\nmy name on it, and I said that was perfect. The award was crystal and\npenis-shaped with a chain around it that looked like it was gold, and I asked\nRalph Destino the president of Cartier if it was gold—because it said\n“Cartier” on it—and he (laughs) said, “Think of it as gold.”"

And James Brady on Page Six was so mean, because he\nreported that Mayor Koch had asked for all thirteen episodes of Brideshead\nRevisited on tape, to imply that that must mean he has a “problem,” but it\nwas mean to put it in the paper when his father just died.\nSo since our lunch was cancelled, I went down to Odeon where Leo’s\nworkers were having a surprise party lunch for him. The ride took an hour\n($10).\nIt was just star-studded. There was a different artist at every table—\nJasper Johns at one table, Robert Rauschenberg at another one, Dan Flavin\nat another, Artschwager at another, Richard Serra. I sat at a table with James\nMayor and Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Lewis and I went over and said, “This is\nthe table I want to sit at because everybody here owes me money.” So Mrs.\nLewis gave me a dime.\nI gave Leo underwear and a snot rag with dollar signs and he loved it, no\none else brought presents. And his wife Toiny was there and I had copies of\nInterview with me and people told me to put it away because it had the\ninterview that showed Leo’s girlfriend Laura de Coppet and she and Leo\nwere still having an affair and people told me it’d caused a big fight—that\nLeo was supposed to go to Rome and Toiny saw the interview and got so\nmad she tore up his ticket and he had to stay in town an extra day. It was the\nbiggest fight ever, they said.\nHans Namuth took every artist to the bathroom to take pictures and I\ndecided to be a camp and I cuddled and felt up Rauschenberg and found out\nhe has a bad body."

And everyone was complaining because the\nWhitney hadn’t loaned the portrait that Alice Neel did of me for the dinner,\nyou have to give them a month’s notice and I said that that was just fine\nwith me, that it was a closet painting. And Alice had a nude of herself. Her\nfamily was there. She turns these paintings out so fast. And the mayor was\nnice, he made a cute speech, one-liners.\nAnd then suddenly some creep got up and started a speech and it was\nStewart Mott and it was the oddest speech. He talked about how Alice Neel\nhad lived in the gutter for so long and didn’t have a pot to pee in and how\nshe lived on like 109th Street on the East Side and then on 105th Street on\nthe West Side and now, as a present to Alice, would the mayor please give\nhis views on nuclear war and disarmament. And the mayor said something\nlike, “Now listen here, we’re finished with your speech.”\nBob told the mayor we wanted him for the cover of Interview and the\nmayor said, “After the election,” and Bob said, “Oh couldn’t it be before?”\nbut the mayor said, “After’ll be better.” So that was disappointing.\nAnd did I ever say that my favorite person is Mrs. Senator Al D’Amato.\nShe actually talks like Judy Holliday.

The place was packed, and it reminded me of years ago, going to\nplaces like Settlement House for these types of things. But years ago they\ndid have better people—Oldenburg and Whitman. Brooke Adams was\nthere, she was sweet, she said hi. And Princess Schleswig-Holstein—Pingle\n—who we sort of let go from working at the office because she was such an\negghead, she was there and now she works at this place about one day a\nweek. We had her give us a tour.\nAnd we saw Henry Post and looked at his boyfriend’s stuff which was\nokay but it was just a copy of Jedd Garet. Jon really sees things in paintings\nthat I don’t see. Like, there was an abstract painting and he saw all these\nfigures of people painted over it. They were there but I hadn’t seen them\nand paintings do have things to say, but I never looked at them that way.\nThere was a cocktail party that Henry was having at Anna Wintour’s\nplace where she lives with that Michael Stone.\nAnd Henry put down the Rauschenberg party the day before, saying his\nwas going to be so grand, so chic. But I’m beginning to think that maybe\nHenry doesn’t really know what an elegant party is like, that he hasn’t been\nto many. Because this party—I mean, they didn’t even really have food. It\nwas 6:30 to 8:30 and it was broken-up crackers. It was on Broadway and\n70th and 71st. And they had big trees and three maids, but so what, because\nthere was no food. And the reason I’m putting it down so much is because\nHenry put down Rauschenberg’s so much, saying how much better his was\ngoing to be. And Jed was there. I’d asked Henry if he was going to be, and\nhe said yes, that Jed was one of his best friends. And there were no stars.\nSteve Rubell was there. But the strangest thing is that he was with the\nprosecutor who sent him to jail! And I think Henry—who actually wrote the\narticle that started all the trouble—I think Henry got them together. I mean,\nit’s like if somebody got you evicted from your apartment and then you\ndecided the next year to be friends with them. Or is it trying to get involved\nwith the guy who’s smart enough to get you, and getting him then involved\nin what you do."

But when you\nthink about it, thirty years ago would somebody really be doing a forgery of\nPicasso? He started to get really really big in 1950. I came to New York in\n1949 and Sidney Janis and those galleries were around and the Museum of\nModern Art and art became really big and Picasso became the number-one\nartist. But it’s very early to have somebody be doing a forgery, so I don’t\nknow.\nThen Thomas had invited Jerry Zipkin and he came by. He puts people\ndown when he’s “on,” though, he thinks he has to entertain. I was saying\nthat Holly Solomon and her husband owned the building that Marilyn\nMonroe and Arthur Miller lived in and Jerry was putting her down, the way\nshe looks, the way she dresses. And Jerry said that what a lot of wives do is\nthey tell their boyfriends they want a $150,000 pin and the boyfriend gives\nthem the money and then they tell the husband the same thing, and he gives\nthe money, and then they buy the pin and they pocket the other $150,000\nand each one thinks they bought it. And also he said that a lot of husbands\nbuy their wives jewelry in the company name so that when they break up,\nthe jewelry belongs back to the company.

It looked\nlike a Barbra Streisand kind of place.\nOh, and on Page Six in the Post a few days ago there was a headline:\n“Warhol Man Does Mick Jagger’s Apartment,” and then the item said that\nJed was the director of Bad and now he decorates apartments, and they said\nthey asked him about it and he said, “No comment.” And there was an\narticle on survivors in the Daily News last Sunday—they asked Lester\nPersky about me and he put me down, he said I was a has-been, it was\nfunny.\nAnd I don’t think I told the Diary this, but Tom Baker, our star of I, a\nMan, died. He O.D.’d. Mickey Ruskin had a wake for him."

My date was Frances Bergen, Charley\nMcCarthy’s (laughs) mother.

And they\ntook a chance, no tent, and it was beautiful that way, but you get shoved and\npushed so much from place to place. Only about eighty people. Then they\nturned on four billion lights. No TV cameras, though, so I wasn’t nervous.\nThe president’s table was right behind me. The president of U.S. Steel\nwas at my table, and I said, “Oh I’m from Pittsburgh and my poor brother is\nout of work from the steel mill”—I was lying like crazy—“and he’s lost his\nmill job and what you should do is put one of the unused buildings to use\nand make it into a Disney World and give tours and charge people $10 to\nget a little coal on their faces and see the hot lava being poured,” and he\nsaid, “Oh what a great idea, why didn’t I think of that?” The Vice-president\nBushes were at our table, and she said that she knew somebody I knew but\nnow I can’t remember who it was.\nThen the speeches came and the president made his quick and then\nMarcos was slow. I relaxed. And then the Fifth Dimension came on and\nsang “Up, Up and Away” and there’s more new members than old. I asked\none of the marines if there was a pay phone and everyone laughed at me.\nBob wanted to stay on and dance. I got the limo and went back to the hotel.\nCalled Jon and then fell asleep at 12:00."

It used\nto be high-class people in the soap operas and now that’s just on Dallas and\nDynasty. Now the people on the daytime soaps are lower-middle class—\nthey don’t have butlers and maids.\nTalked to Jon in New Hampshire.\nWent to Halston’s for dinner and Martha Graham was there, and she\nlooked frail, like she’s on her last legs. And then Steve Rubell came, and\nJane Holzer with her son Rusty, who’s so handsome now. And he’s smart. I\ntalked to him the whole time. He goes to Buckley and he had the highest\naverage and he studies all the time from after school till bedtime, and then\nhe studies some more in the morning before school to maintain his 93\naverage.

And I had Rusty go say\nhello to her, and she was aloof, she said, “Do I know you?” and he said, “Of\ncourse,” and she said, “Oh yes, about a year ago,” and he said, “No, two\nyears ago,” and so he was annoyed, she was putting him down, but Jane\nexplained to him that girls get nervous and do that.\nThe turkey was organic, from Jane’s Pennsylvania farm.

The girl said how these old photographers tried to pick her up\nand one took her to dinner at Le Relais and tried to impress her, saying he’d\nmade this one and that one—made their careers—and this young girl was\ntelling me about it and laughing at him.\nSo then finally we went to Halston’s and Halston wasn’t anywhere in\nsight. It was odd. Although we were four hours late. But finally we found\nhim upstairs with Steve Rubell, next to the tree. Halston gave me—maybe\n—two Elsa Peretti candlesticks from Tiffany, but I had to sign a note saying\nthat I would return them to Halston if it turned out that he couldn’t get\nanother pair for himself. So that’s a new one. And I was a wreck, trying to\nfigure out what size paintings to give to who. It was harrowing.\nAnd Steve Rubell gave me five cassettes. And he kept saying it over and\nover: “I gave you five cassettes. Isn’t that just the greatest gift?” I mean,\nthey were just tapes that you can buy, like a Michael Jackson tape, that cost\n$3 apiece. I mean, Steve was cheap when he had money, and now that he\ndoesn’t have any …"

And I\nhear he has the agent named Janklow, a big literary lawyer. I wonder if Jann\nWenner’s offered him a job because he’s been having meetings with him\nlately, but I don’t think so, because they’d never get along. I’m happy for\nBob. Really I am. But I mean, he should have kept working until we found\na replacement. It’s awful of him to just leave with no notice. Fred called and\ntalked to him but nothing changed. I think Thomas Ammann must have\nencouraged him. Thomas has gotten so grand, too. I mean, I see people that\nI knew so long ago, and suddenly they have airs.\nSo nobody at the office knows except the people I said. But (laughs),\neverybody outside the office knows. But this has been building up for a\nwhile. Before Bob went away for the holidays I’d told him he could have\nany painting he wanted for Christmas and he said a Hammer & Sickle, and I\nonly have two of those and I said, “Gee, Bob, just anything but that,” and he\ngot mad. But Bob has gotten so grand, he goes to these rich people’s places\nand he thinks he should have it all, too. But magazine editors don’t make\nthat much. And Bob made so much off other things— he got commissions\non the portraits and he has 50 percent of that Bruno photography portfolio.\nBut what he really wanted was 50 percent of Interview—at least I think he\nsaid 50, I couldn’t really hear if he was saying 50 or 15. I told him then that\nhe could have a percentage of the profits, when Interview started making\nsome profits, but it’s not making any yet. And then he said that it was. But\nit’s just not. And if Bob was smart, he could have just hired someone to do\nthe routine things that he does for Interview and just overseen the magazine,\ndo it freelance. I think maybe that’s what Fred’s going to ask him to do.\nAnyway, I think he’ll be back.\nAnd John Powers brought a possible portrait by—a plastic surgeon from\nHorida. And Mr. LeFrak came while they were there and John was great, he\nembarrassed Mr. LeFrak into finally accepting the portraits—he told him\nwhat more do you want, and then later he told me, “I can’t believe you\nmade him look so good.”\nSo I got home about 7:00, dropped Jay (cab $5). Decided to stay home,\ntalked on the phone to Christopher and Fred.\nYou know, about Bob leaving, it’s not about money, because he was\nmaking a lot. And it’s not about the Hammer & Sickle, because if it wasn’t\nabout that it would have been about something else. He’s been leading up to\nthis for a long time. Maybe he’s going into business with Thomas Ammann,\ntoo. Because Bob is good at selling art. If a person says they don’t want a\nportrait, Bob will just make a face and walk away. And he’s not shy about\nasking people to pay their bills. Even Fred is a little shy about that. But Bob\nisn’t. If he’s got a good new job I’m happy for him. He just shouldn’t have\nquit with no notice. That’s the bad thing, it’s not professional."

Diana had just signed a\ncontract with the Golden Nugget to play in this room, they’re paying her a\nlot, and she’s never played a small room before, so she wanted to see it.\nAnd I had a fight with the assistant art director girl at Interview, I called\nher dumb, but then I cooled down. It was like Mr. Brodovich, the famous\nart director at Bazaar, when he used to scream at me. You know, it was just\npeople doing what they want to do after you tell them what to do. But Fred\ntold me that you can get more out of people if you tell them they’re dumb in\na nice way, so the situation cooled down.\nAnd the Twiggy cover came out so bad—it was so ugly, Twiggy in a\nsnood—that we’re going to use a Robert Risko caricature for the cover.\nBecause Vanity Fair is coming out and they’re stealing all our artists, so we\nwanted to get this look out first since it’s going to be their look.\nThen suddenly it was 5:00 and I had to be home by 5:15 when Diana\nRoss was picking me up to go to the helicopter (cab $5.50). Just had time to\nput my contacts in. The doorbell rang and it was just Diana alone, so I was\nnervous. Then we went to the 60th Street place and got a Pan Am helicopter\nthat the Golden Nugget was paying for.\nWe had to wait a few minutes for her lawyer, and also going down with\nus was Frank Sinatra’s tailor who had an Italian name but looked Jewish.\nAnd I liked the lawyer, there was something adorable about him. I’ve\nnoticed that all these people on top have a twinkle in their eye, their eyes\ntwinkle. And he kept calling Los Angeles all night because of the big floods\nthere, to find out if his house had gone down the drain with his wife and\nkids. As a matter of fact, everybody from California was calling to find out\nif their houses were still there. Diana called, too. And you’d hear things\nfrom the phone like, “Oh no! The neighbor’s house just went!”\nI told Diana she should really marry Barry Diller and she said how could\nshe take a girlfriend’s man—meaning Diane Von Furstenberg. I told her she\nreally had to do more movies.\nAnd we talked about David Geffen. I told her she should really be\nfriends with him again because he was in with that crowd, and she said that\nthey had been really good friends, that he was so great to her when her\nmother had cancer, he took her to Sloan-Kettering when she had no idea at\nall what to do, and I asked her when this was and she said, “Last year.” So I\nsaid, “Well, what happened?” And she sort of said Dreamgirls, the musical\nthat’s about the Suprêmes but they don’t call them the Suprêmes. Geffen\nproduced it. She said that at first she was going to sue but then she didn’t.\nAnd Diana tips people herself and does everything herself. It’s really\ngreat.\nAnd as we left New York the skyline was so beautiful.\nWhen we got to Atlantic City the guy who met us was somebody who\nEdmund Gaultney had brought to the office once. He took us to the Golden\nNugget and it turns out his brother, Steve Wynn, owns it. He was there with\nhis wife and kids, and they’re a good-looking American family—I couldn’t\ntell if they were Italian or Jewish.\nAnd Diana couldn’t decide which of two outfits to wear. I said I’d be her\nhairdresser and decide, but then I couldn’t decide, either. She finally put on\na skimpy white dress, but then later changed her mind and wore tight black\npants and a top. So I got a tour of the Golden Nugget and that was exciting.\nThere were literally eighteen restaurants, and Victorian was the style for\neverything. I asked the guy why everything was Victorian and he said\nnobody gambled if it looks modern.\nWe went up an escalator five stories high. They said they’d send a plane\nfor me whenever I wanted, but when I said I wasn’t a gambler they dropped\nme. Diana is a big gambler, though, but she hasn’t gambled there yet.\nThen they said that Frank Sinatra always goes on on time and so we got\nto the room and it’s about 500 seats. They sell 200 and then give 300 to the\nhigh rollers. Frank came on and he did all his songs and it was great.\nAnd he introduced Diana Ross and me in the audience, he said, “We\nhave two fabulous, famous people in the audience, each in their own fields,\none an artist, one a singer,” and the introduction went on for a long time.\nAnd Barbara Sinatra was between us. She was wearing a little black dress,\nshe looks great. I couldn’t think of what to say so I asked her if her son was\nstill dating Barbara Allen, although I knew he wasn’t.\nAfterward we went to their suite and for the first time Frank shook\nhands with me. And gee, he looks great. How old is he? About sixty-seven?\nAnd he doesn’t wear a toupee. I’m sure. I’m an expert, and I really would\nsay absolutely not—I think he’s maybe had transplants and that they look\nreally good. And the tailor was there measuring for suits, and he was\nstraight but he was kissing and hugging all these guys like a gay seamstress.\nIt was so camp. And I didn’t have my camera so I didn’t take pictures, but\nanybody who tried to, the security people put their hands over the camera in\nsort of a great way.\nFrank said he was doing a song on his next album with Michael Jackson,\nand Diana said, “Why don’t you do one with we?”\nWhen Diana and I were alone for a moment, I told her that there were so\nmany people with “funny names” here, and she pushed her nose sideways\nand said, “You mean like this?” And it was funny, it looked so Mafia. Home\nat 12:00."

She doesn’t want to think of herself as that brown-\nhaired person.”\nDecided to see The Outsiders which was just opening, and I loved it, it\nwas like watching Lonesome Cowboys. You can’t believe it—young boys\nwith dyed hair reading poetry in the sunset. The Sal Mineo type. And then\nthey’re in this old church hiding and the boy says, “All I really want you to\ndo is read Gone with the Wind out loud to me.” And all the boys are so cute.\nAnd this schmaltzy music playing as if the boys are going to kiss. Things\nwere all cut up so they didn’t make sense. It was like seeing Bruce Weber\nphotographs. Every boy was a raving beauty."

Well, she’s\nstill out there. And here’s my sister-in-law telling me all things I don’t want\nto hear, like, “Do you realize it’s the anniversary of your father’s death? Did\nyou go to church for Assumption?” [Note: Andy’s father died in May 1942\nwhen Andy was thirteen.]"

Penney concept.\nSunday June 26, 1983—Montauk—New York\nWe went over to Gurney’s Inn and I’d never been there. It’s next to Edward\nAlbee’s. Gurney’s has the rustic look. It’s modern with a cave in the wall. It\nhas balconies that are 4’ X 6’, and when we were on one balcony looking\ndown on another, we could see these two men counting out hundred-dollar\nbills on green felt. I guess a boat had just smuggled in some drugs."

Just the event of the century—her hair blowing and soaking wet,\nand if only they’d had a covering on the place where she was, she could\nhave kept on singing and the kids would have stayed and she would have\nhad her concert for TV. But they stopped it in the middle of the storm and\nthey’re going to do it again tomorrow. She was crying, and Barry Diller was\ntrying to get her to stop but she said that she’d waited for twenty years to do\nthis. The lightning made it dangerous, I guess, but it was like a dream, like a\nhallucination, watching this spectacle. It was like the greatest scene from a\nmovie ever. When they do her life story in the movies you can just see this\nhuge event and then later she’s crying and saying, “Why did this happen to\nme?” and then drinking and slitting her wrists. But oh, the thunder and\nlightning looked so great. So beautiful.\nWe were in the VIP area, but because I’d had Benjamin bring an\numbrella, we weren’t sitting under the canopy. And Rob Lowe was with us\nand he’s so beautiful. It’s like his eyebrows are penciled on and his lips\npainted on—everything so perfect. And he’s just like the kids we know, just\nregular, and he’s looking for girls, that’s all he can think about. I asked him\nto draw me a pussy and he drew a pussy and then I said, “What’s that?” and\nI then drew him a cat. And he and his girl friend are sort of breaking up\nbecause whenever she called him on location in Canada the operator would\nsay, “He’s in Nastassia Kinski’s room,” so then when he would tell her the\nnext day that his phone had been out of order she would tell him to stop\nlying. And he says he’s not in love with Nastassia, though, that it’s just sex.\nBut he was wearing a toy snake around his waist which was a joke on her\nAvedon poster, so he was thinking about her so maybe he is in love. He’s\nnineteen. And he was just after any old lady. Just anybody. Like Susan\nSarandon. She was there with Richard Gere and Silvinha.\nAnd oh you should have seen it. Jerry Zipkin in the soaking rain. And I\nfelt so sorry for Jon because he’s worked so hard on this, because\nParamount owns Showtime which got the film rights.\nAnd then finally people were leaving the park and so we followed the\nblacks and wound up coming out at 72nd Street near the Dakota. And we\nhad to climb a wall and fall into three feet of mud. It was like being in a war\nzone. And then after we got out of the park I took Rob Lowe and Benjamin\nto Café Central—I said all the stars go there, Matt Dillon and Sean Penn—\nand then we got there and had drinks and absolutely nobody was there\n(drinks $83.50).\nThen I got home and called Rob Lowe at the Sherry and he said that he\nwas waiting for a phone call from Nastassia, so that I should just go ahead\nwithout him over to the Gulf + Western building for the party. So I went and\nwhen I got there, he was getting out of the cab. So that was kind of mean. I\nwas hurt. I guess he didn’t want to be seen with us again because we were\nbeing campy and outrageous. And I said to him, you know, “I just was\ngoing to give you a ride, that’s all—it was no big deal.”\nAnd Cornelia had been at the park, too. And a newspaper photographer\ntook her and pushed her next to one of the people who were stabbed, just to\nget that kind of a picture of a socialite and a stabbed person. Cornelia didn’t\nknow what was going on.\nAnd at the party at the Gulf + Western Rob was after Cornelia and\nMaura. He and Cornelia kept going off alone.\nI gave Diana Ross a Diamond painting. She was looking at tapes of the\nconcert. Barry Diller came over and I told him the concert was so great and\nhe said, “You always like disasters. You liked Grease II.”\nHarvey Mann who works for Liz Smith was there and he was asking me\nif I’d heard anything more about Calvin and AIDS. He said that they’d\nkilled the rumor in their column. And then Calvin came in and he kissed me\nso hard and his beard was stubbly and I was so afraid that it was piercing\ninto my pimple and being like a needle and giving me AIDS. So if I’m gone\nin three years …\nAnd by the way, Rob Lowe also said that up in Canada where they were\nall shooting Hotel New Hampshire, Jodie Foster was reading the Philosophy\nbook."

It was 99 percent black. The\nguy who owns Café Central took us out of the park so we came out at the\nright spot uptown to go to Café Central. He had a cane.\nAnd when we got there, Rob Lowe came and Andrew McCarthy who’s\nalso in the movie Class. He gets Jacqueline Bisset. And he’s just regular, a\nnice kid.\nAt Café Central they’re trying to treat people rotten to be like Elaine’s.\nThe waitress came to our table and said, “You’ve got to leave this table, it’s\nreserved for Lorna Luft.” And Cornelia just burst out laughing that anyone\nwould ask her to move to make room for Lorna Luft. And it was so stupid\nbecause if they’d just been nice and said, “Would you mind since there’s not\nso many of you now, moving to a smaller table?” I mean, they knew we\nwere leaving anyway because we’d said we were going to the 11:00 show\nof Class, which Rob and Andrew had passes for. Maybe this kind of\ntreatment makes some people want to go there, but it sure doesn’t make me\nwant to go there (dinner $100 with tip).\nSo then we went over to 66th and Second and Cornelia was chattering\naway, she repeats everything over and over, just like her mother, she has to\nkeep talking.

And he pulled a knife out of his waist, and I couldn’t believe it. I was\nsurprised that he’s so small. He’s about my size, and in a way he’s like Mr.\nMilquetoast. And he pulled out these pictures of his three sons from a\nleather envelope. And here’s the big bruisers in swimsuits and you can see\nthe outlines of their dicks. These were like 8” X 10” color photographs—\nartistic, with ripples in the water! I mean, this is a very strange way to take\npictures of your kids to carry around! And he was thrilled because one of\nthe kids was going to be a Marine. They’re all at Fordham. And he said his\ngirls didn’t want him to carry their pictures, but I’m sure he didn’t care\nabout the girls, he was just thrilled with the big bruisers. And one of the\nboys had a two-inch cat, a little kitten, that he was holding. And he also had\npictures of his house, on the Potomac. And Tim was there with his hippie\ntalk, and Gordon Liddy would spout facts about how many A-bombs have\nbeen exploded. And he’s sort of lost, Liddy, it’s odd. It’s like he doesn’t\nknow what to do with himself. He liked me a lot, he wants us to see more of\neach other. Tim left and he stayed on for a while."

I\ndidn’t hear a thing about it.\nThen Christopher wanted to have dinner. He said he hadn’t eaten all day\nso he promised that he would actually eat the dinner and not have it\nwrapped to take home.

Guccione was wearing a shirt\nand tie, he had his gold chains covered over. I’d heard he was in the hospital\nfor a head tumor or something like that, but maybe it was hair transplants.\nPia had on a beautiful ring—a diamond with blue sapphires, and she was\nwearing a Bob Mackie, red, white, and with a blue star. It really was a\nbeautiful dress. Slit up to the ass and when the wind blew once, one of the\nphotographers groaned, “Oh my God, I missed a pussy shot.” And the\nfunniest line was one Benjamin heard. When they showed the portraits, one\nof the photographers said, “How could Andy Warhol sink to such\nmediocrity?” and the photographer he said it to said, “What do you mean?\nHe’s famous for sinking to mediocrity.”\nAnd it’s funny because there everybody is at this party for her and they\nstill all put her down. Oh, but I was gushing because Riklis came over and\nsaid, “How can we get the rest of the portraits? Let’s talk about it.” I was\nthrilled.\nI snuck out at 7:30. Left Jay there looking for Bunnies.

With the\ngay fashion look of bracelets and pink shirts and pink belts. They’re\nstraight, but that’s how those film-crew guys dress now.\nWe decided to go to dinner at the Café Seiyoken at 9:30.

He was drinking Jack Daniel’s and he came\nover and he was sweet.

I don’t think I’ll go back again because of the noise,\nbut they’re advertisers, so it was good to go.\nThen Steve sent his driver to pick us up to go to meet them at that\nVanDam restaurant. And so we went and in addition to Steve and Ryan and\nFarrah, Bob Colacello was there. And Bob looks good, he was his old story-\ntelling self. Ryan is so desperate, he calls you “Baby” and “Honey” and he\nkisses all the boys on the lips, it’s so sick. Farrah was also so peculiar. She\nmade Keith draw on her arm. And then Ryan and Farrah were nervous so\nthey took a walk around the block to smoke a joint. Because I guess it was\ntense because Bianca had had an affair with Ryan.\nThen I raved to Steve about Area, the new disco at 157 Hudson Street,\nand we went there. I’d been to the opening the other night, and so the guy\nlet us in, but Steve shoved him aside and motioned us all in the door. It was\nfunny, it was (laughs) like he was the club owner and letting us in, but he’d\nnever even been there before. Marcie Klein was there and she could only\ntalk about wanting to meet Rob Lowe.\nThen it was 3:00 and Bianca wanted to go, so I dropped her at Marcie\nKlein’s boyfriend’s house, and then dropped Marcie on 83rd Street (cab\n$10)."

It was at their townhouse on Riverview Terrace, off\nSutton Place, outside in the back, and she had the whole waterfront lit up.\nThere were crowds of people. About fifty tables with ten people at each\ntable, and they were all in costumes of 1890,I was the only one in black tie.\nAhmet Ertegun was in a fez. Jerry Zipkin had a mustache. I ran into Mrs.\nHeinz when I got there and told her my date Cornelia had cancelled, and\nshe said, “Well in that case you’ll be sitting next to no one.” And I asked her\nwhere Malcolm Forbes was because I had something for him, and she said,\n“Oh just throw it over the wall.” I didn’t know what to think about that, she\nwas just being glib. So I was supposed to be at table 2, which was a good\ntable, but when I got there my name wasn’t on any of the cards.\nI ran into Jeane Kirkpatrick who I’ve been watching on TV because of\nthe Korean flight 007 Soviet thing, and that was exciting.\nSo I’d been moved to Table 18 and there was no other person at this\nhuge table except for some artist who was doing work for the Heinzes. It\nwas so strange—there we were alone and all the really important people\nwere up another level. Tom Wolfe was next to a man, too. But I mean, this\nartist and I, we were down there alone. He was actually cute and fun. I\nthought he was gay because he was alone, but he said they’d told him he\ncouldn’t bring a date so his girl didn’t come. His name was Ned. And so we\ngave each other the presents we’d brought for Mr. Heinz. His is still\nwrapped—it’s a drawing and I haven’t unwrapped it because it looks so\nnice wrapped.\nThey had fireworks. And I got drunk. The food was good, not the canned\nstuff. They had 100 waiters, great-looking fairies, and they couldn’t figure\nout why we were down there alone at this table. People came and asked us\nto go up, but I didn’t. Henry Geldzahler was there and he asked, but I\ndidn’t. Then Ned said he had to go to the bathroom, and I said if he did I\nwas leaving and he said, “Tough”—he was drunk, too. But I didn’t leave. It\nwas so cold, I just lose my thinking when it gets cold. You just sit there like\na bump. If all this had happened inside somebody’s house I would have\ngotten up and left right away, but I just felt stuck. I just sat there in the cold.\nAnd then the artist came back and then I left. Before dessert. It was the\nstrangest thing, and my last party at the Heinzes’."

Tony Shafrazi was there and Keith Haring, and Lou\nReed looking so glum, so peculiar. His wife looks more Puerto Rican every\ntime I see her. I don’t know if Lou is big or not. Rolling Stone gave his\nalbum four stars, but was it a hit? Ronnie said Lou’s in A.A. so I guess he’s\nnot drinking.

But\nthen he lived in that neighborhood, anyway, so maybe he was just hanging\nout.

He was there to try to pick up the waitress he’d seen the\nnight before. I felt really mad at him because he’d lied and said that he\nwasn’t going out. I mean, all he had to do was tell the truth. I mean, I’m not\na kid (dinner $120).\nCalled Benjamin a few times but he said he was tired because he’d\nworked till 5:00 at the Pyramid Club as a drag queen. But Mark is a\ndoorman at the Pyramid and he said they close before that, so I don’t know\nif Benjamin was lying to me, too.\nSo then dropped Mark and Sam off ($6) and when I got home I was just\nso mad at Jay and all these kids. I felt so used and abused and lied to.\nWatched a good TV show on HBO. For the first time I saw why Andy\nKaufman was funny, so clever. He had a plant in the audience saying, “You\ndon’t do anything new—the same old routine for ten years,” and then the\nguy is yelling the lines with him, and then Andy Kaufman really starts to\nsweat and you don’t know if it’s real or not.

And Clemente the Italian artist\nwas there, and gee, I like him a lot—he’s picked up the American attitude.\nHe understands American humor, which is so strange, because you don’t\nunderstand how a person from another country can pick it up. He doesn’t\nsay much, he just sits and eats and watches. Bianca’s trying to get him to do\na free mural for her apartment. She’s buttering up all the artists.\nAnd this other guy at the lunch had been a political prisoner somewhere\nin South America I think, and now he works for Mitterrand.\nIt turned into a five-hour lunch. The Nicaraguan cultural minister girl\ndidn’t get there until late. She’s almost as pretty as Bianca. And she says,\n“Oh yes, people think we don’t have art in a revolution but even as the\nbombs are falling and the bullets are flying, people are still making art. We\nhave dancers and painters and photographers, and we’re becoming\nunionized \"I mean … and then she was saying how the true revolution is\nreally winning out, that “the people are having their day.” And I don’t know,\nit was all so abstract, but then being at that big Heinz party the other night\nwith all those rich Republicans I got a creepy feeling there, too. It’s like any\npeople when they have the power, they don’t want anyone else to ever get\nit. It’s like women trying to keep their husbands away from seeing what\nyoung girls look like. But I guess that’s not only the rich.\nAnyway, they’re saying they want us to come down to Nicaragua and,\nand I don’t know, support their art cause. And Clemente is saying, “Oh\nyeah, sure, and lose the green card I went through so much to get.” And\nthen when we were finally done, the rebel girl got into her limousine, and\nthe Socialist who works for Mitterrand got into his limousine, and we went\ndown to Clemente’s loft, which is right next to Tower Records, and his loft\nis just beautiful. It’s really an artist’s loft, big paintings all over. He\nproduces a lot. So many paintings. And the Mitterrand guy was awful, he\nwalked on one of them that was on the floor and pretended he thought it\nwas a rug, but I just know he knew it was a painting.\nThen they wanted to see my “studio” so we went to the office, and there\nwas just nothing there. The contrast was so—evident. We’ve gotten so\ninvolved with fashion that we don’t know about all these other things like\nwars and governments anymore. I didn’t have any art to show them. They\nwanted to see movies, but I didn’t have any movies, either.\nSo finally they all left. I worked till 7:30 and Cornelia called and asked\nwhere I was because she was ready, and I had a black tie down there, so I\njust stuck it on and went to the Waldorf Towers. I asked her to be\ndownstairs since we were late, but she said, “I don’t want to wait\ndownstairs like a prostitute.” So when I got there the doorman was so\ndumb, after fifteen minutes of me sitting in the cab he came out and said\nthere was no Mr. Warhol staying there. So I did it myself, rang Cornelia’s\nroom and she came down in a red dress looking like a hooker. But beautiful.\nShe’s put on a little weight. Oh, and I saw Mrs. Douglas MacArthur while I\nwas waiting and she was great. She’s eighty-four or something and still has\nall her marbles. And me, I can barely walk. So then Cornelia came and we\nwent to the Pierre (cab $8) to this fashion show for charity that Joanne\nWinship organized.\nOh, and at lunch I brought up the Liz Smith items about Calvin and his\nmodel Kelly to Bianca, saying the papers said they were such a hot item,\nand Bianca said, “Ha-ha! What a joke!” So that’s her position."

She said she’d never show or sell\nhis stuff again. I told her I’d let her do an exhibit of my work called “The\nWorst of Warhol” where I would just go into my closets and find all the\nreally horrible stuff that had never worked out, so then she cheered up a\nlittle.

Got into black tie.\nWent over there and talked to David Whitney. The photographers wanted a picture of me and Bianca, but she\nwas being difficult. She was in a Calvin.\nThen we went in Steve Rubell’s car to the Four Seasons. Shook hands with Jackie O., she never invited me to\nher Christmas party again, so she’s a creep. And now I wouldn’t go if she did. I’d tell her to go mind her own\nbusiness. I mean, I’m the same age, so I can tell her off. Although I do feel like she’s older than me. But then, I\nfeel like everybody’s older than me.\nPhilip was sort of cute. He said that it wasn’t his exhibition, it was his execution. David Whitney was having\nmartinis and he said that as soon as Philip popped off he and I could get together. I laughed it off, but later he said\nI had to kiss him on the lips. I really didn’t know he actually felt this way about me! I always thought he was\nkidding. And Philip gave a speech and David laughed and clapped. He’s smart, David.\nBob Rauschenberg had me kiss him on the lips, too. And then later a pretty girl groupie kissed me on the lips.\nSo if I catch anything the Diary will know where it’s from. I left Bianca there without saying goodbye (cab $7)."

Last year it was retro. If you had a thirties watch on last\nyear it was chic. But now it’s back to Corums and things. Pocket watches are out. Wristwatches are in, but they’re\nsort of finishing. That’s the second collecting trend that I started, the wristwatch one. The first was Deco. This year\nyou can get pocket watches that were $12,000 last year for $4,000. And ones that were $85,000 you can get now\nfor $35,000.\nWe went to the office and I read the Rolling Stone where Jann Wenner puts down all his best friends. He put me\nin with the most “Overrated People.” And you’d think since he owns my Maos that he’d be putting me up. I\nwonder why not. Oh I know, maybe he sold them!

And when the car stopped there were people\nlying all over the sidewalk and other people screaming and running. It made me really sick. Jon ran over to try to\nhelp. Some people who weren’t hit were trying to help the others, but there were other people trying to get Cartier\npackages away from people who’d been hit. Jon found this boy on the ground who didn’t have anybody with him,\nhe was from Yale, and he asked Jon to slip his Cartier package in his inside pocket so no one would steal it.\nAmbulances got there in just a second, though. Lots of Empire ambulances. Where do they come from so fast, I\nwonder. It was chaos. And I was standing next to George Plimpton and I asked him if he was going down to the\nlunch, but he didn’t answer me, he was being grand. When Jon was done I thought he’d have blood all over him,\nbut he didn’t.\nThen later on after seeing on the news about all these other disasters, the bomb at Harrod’s and the fire in\nMadrid, it was great that not one person in this Fifth Avenue thing was badly injured. And what happened, it\nturned out, was that a traffic cop told this guy in the passenger seat of some car in front of Doubleday to move, and\nthe guy couldn’t drive but I guess his foot just went onto the accelerator accidentally because they didn’t charge\nhim with anything.\nSo it was all really odd and I can still see it in my eyes. It could have been us, or anything.\nAt “21” the hat-check girl said, “I know who you are.” And I thought she was making a reference to my dirty\ncoat which the other day they hadn’t even wanted to check, they just threw it on the floor. But later on she asked\nme for my autograph, so I guess that was why she said it.\nAfter lunch walked up Madison still feeling peculiar because of the accident."

And this cheerleading\nwould be just something they’d do “for fun,” they don’t get paid. So they’d better get themselves a football player\nor they’ll walk away with nothing. And somebody told Ivana she’d better watch her husband because she could\nlose him to these young girls, but then later somebody told me that he fooled around with all the girls anyway. And\nseeing these young things and then a sophisticated “lady” like Ivana, you’d think that some day they could be like\nthat, too—if they marry right.\nAnd they all had to dance to “Billie Jean” by Michael Jackson, so we all had to hear “Billie Jean” seventy\ntimes during the tryouts, so it was sick.\nWent to Beulah Land on 10th Street and Avenue A (cab $6) to see the photography show of the kids at the\noffice—Benjamin and Paige and Jennifer—and it was right near where I first lived when I came to New York, on\nSt. Mark’s Place and Avenue A. And I thought about how hard it was then, walking all that way home from the\nsubway on Astor Place with my drawings and then dragging them up seven flights of stairs. And when we got to\nBeulah Land they said that I’d just missed everybody’s mother and father and relatives, and I was so glad I had.\nLike Jennifer’s mother and father and Paige’s aunts and uncles. And Benjamin’s photos were like my ideas—\nmanhole covers that all looked the same but they were actually all different. And Benjamin is the only one who\nsold anything—Jeffrey Deitch from Citicorp bought them. And Paige has so much energy, she did the Peter Beard\nlook—writing little things—and it’s almost there but how many things can you do with photographs? Stayed there\nan hour then went to the party at Pyramid for it. And it was the same crowd there. And these two clubs are the only\nplaces I’ve been to where the kids actually do dress the Fiorucci way—like wearing three dresses at once."

I’ve been forgetting to tell the Diary. And Fred was at this table, too, so he was going nuts trying to look\naway from her. She’s still with the same husband, Henry. And instead of running up to Paloma I ran up to horrible\nRosemary Kent, who’s still writing her stupid “What’s In/What’s Out” articles, you know—“Handbags! Shoes!\nAndy Warhol’s wigs!”—and tried in my heart not to think she was awful, because God forgives so so should I.\nSee, I’m sure I got sick the other day as punishment because I yelled at that lady. Didn’t I tell the Diary? A real\nestate lady called the office and said she wanted to show our floor to some people and I screamed that she\ncouldn’t, that our lease wasn’t up and that she better not set one foot on the premises until it was, and she said she\ncouldn’t believe that a nice person and an artist like me would be yelling at her. And then I got sick.\nPaloma’s party just missed. The people were too old or something. I’ve decided I’m just going to go to\nopenings of stores and galleries, that’s my new philosophy.\nAnd the big news of the day was that Rupert’s house in New Hope, Pennsylvania, burned down, so he didn’t\ncome in.

I just closed my eyes and headed through the park with people pointing at me all the\nway—“That’s that famous artist.”\nSo then at the other end of the park I met Jon and we walked. And I had with me all the corn flakes that were\nstale to give to the birds, but I found a spot without birds, so I guess I actually fed the rats.\nBought New York ($1.50). Looked at the movies, decided to see The Ten Commandments (cab $4, tickets $10,\npopcorn $10). And let me go on record: Cecil B. DeMille is the worst director ever. We’d missed an hour but it\nwas still three hours to go and a half-hour intermission. And all those actors were terrible. I mean, Edward G.\nRobinson, forget it. And forget Yvonne DeCarlo and Ann Baxter, too. Charlton Heston was okay, he was good-\nlooking. The orgy scene was (laughs) people dropping grapes on each other—it sounds like an old Andy Warhol\nmovie, right? And then they would lift their skirt two inches off the floor. That was it. That was the orgy. Edward\nG. Robinson—you couldn’t believe it. And Dustin Hoffman is going to wind up in his shoes, I just know it.\nThe movie finished. Benjamin had called in the afternoon and said that Victor was coming in from L.A. for a\nbirthday party for him at Halston’s. And that made me nervous, after hearing about Marvin Gaye’s father shooting\nhim. I could just picture Victor going nuts and jumping out a window or something dramatic. And by the way, last\nweek when I was trying to clean up, I picked up a box and out fell the picture of Marvin and me that PH took in\nlike 1976.\nWent home, glued, then I went over to Halston’s. Wait a minute, somebody’s ringing my doorbell … it’s those\nstupid Polacks again. They’re still coming over and ringing my bell! So okay, at Halston’s, at midnight, Victor\narrived. I gave him a framed Keith Haring T-shirt and he hated it and threw it away, but then he said he wanted it\nback for the frame. He’s staying at the Barbizon, I think.\nAnd then Alana Stewart arrived and Bianca and Alana wrestled on the floor for fun and I would have gotten the\nbest pictures but I’d forgotten my camera. Alana’s in town for the opening of Where the Boys Are."

Then on the third time he did and he told me that he’d been at the Roxy, Lou Adler’s place, “with\nJack and Shirley and Debra and Warren and Richard Pryor and Timothy Hutton.” Just about thirty people. And\nthen there were parties at Morton’s and Spago, and he got home at 5:00, so he felt like a movie star.\nDr. Karen came to the office and she decided to set up an office at the office, so that was fun.\nI made an appointment to see a nutritionist. Dr. Linda Li on the West Side.\nGael Love called a few times. Robert Hayes has been out with a cold for three weeks, and somebody put a bug\nin my head, like “What’s wrong with Robert?” But Gael said, “No, no, it’s nothing like that.”\nWent to pick up John Reinhold to take him to Yoko’s black-tie birthday dinner for Vasarely’s (cab $4). So we\nwent to the Dakota and had to leave our shoes in the hallway. She had lots of pretty boys as waiters. I couldn’t tell\nwhich one was Sam Havadtoy. Her live-in love. He’s a decorator. And it was very chic. We ate in the kitchen, it\nwas fresh vegetables and pasta and maybe something like veal. I couldn’t recognize anybody but everybody was\nsomebody. John Cage was there and Merce Cunningham.\nAnd little Sean Lennon fell in love with me, just madly. He said, “Why is your hair like that?” I said, “Punk.”\nHe said, “What’s your name?” I said, “Adam.” Then I asked him to get me a double champagne and when he came\nback with it he said somebody had told him I was Andy Warhol, and then he went around to everyone telling them,\n“Do you know who that is? That’s Andy Warhol.” And I did my old trick, I tore a dollar bill in half for him. And\nhe said, “You have to give me an autograph,” and so I signed, “To Sean, Andy.” And he said, “I’m not interested in\nyour first name, I want your last one.” And I told him that I wasn’t so famous at all, that the other people were\nthere really famous, like John Cage, and that he should get his autograph. So he did, and John signed the most\nbeautiful signature. And then Sean had him sign a “J” and then he came over and ripped the “J” in half and gave\nme half. But John had done it on the back of the really beautiful signature so that was ruined—Sean could have\nhad a beautiful John Cage autograph.\nOh, and when I was cleaning at home just the other week, out of a drawer fell pictures of John and Yoko that\nI’d taken in the sixties or early seventies, and two of the photographs were double exposures of their faces, and it\nkilled me to give one of those up, but I did. The one where you could tell them apart I gave to her, and the one\nwhere the features were all together I kept. When could I have taken those photos? Let’s see… I was going around\ntown with John and Yoko when I was looking to buy a building downtown, so it was before I got the Bowery\nplace, which was around ‘69, and there were three buildings on Greene Street, each for $200,000, that were all\nbeing sold together and Yoko was going to buy one and John was going to buy one and I was going to buy one.\nBut then Yoko got greedy and wanted all three. And then they wound up not buying any of them. But by then I’d\nbeen pushed out of the picture. And that building would be worth millions today. I think that was the year she had\nthat show in upstate New York where she flew everybody up there on one of those creaky airlines, like One-Way\nAir or something. She spent $25,000 to fly everybody up there but then she didn’t have any other freebie for them\n—no food or anything. Just up there. And there was an “in” party and an “out” party, that kind of stuff. What year\nwas that in? I can’t remember if it was before I was shot or after. It could have been ‘67 or ‘68 or ‘69 or ‘71. I just\ndon’t know. What makes me think it was before I got shot was that it was just me who went up there and I think if\nit was after I was shot then Jed would have come, too.\nDinner was served and I sat next to Walter Cronkite and Sean, and I told Sean that if he wanted to be a host he\nshould get us food. And I had him take pictures for me of all the shoes lined up in the hallway. And Sean had the\nflu and the girl next to Walter Cronkite had the flu and so I was being coughed on, so I just know I’ll get it.\nI talked to Walter Cronkite and that was interesting. I told him I’d just read the Jody Powell thing in Rolling\nStone. He said he thought Carter was the most intelligent president. And he said that years ago when he went to\ninterview Nixon one of those times he was running for president, they sat him outside the door and he heard Nixon\non the phone saying “piss” and “cocksucker” and “fuck,” and Walter Cronkite thought it was a setup to have him\nhear all this so he would think Nixon was really macho, but then years later when the Watergate tapes came out he\nwas surprised to hear Nixon talking like that all the time.\nAnd then I heard Sean talking to this guy and asking what his name was and he said, “Coppola,” so then I told\nhim how much I loved The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. And we talked about how he had so many great kids in\nthose two movies, that it was like American Graffiti—all the kids would become the next generation of big stars.\nAnd I didn’t know Coppola was from New York. He said he went to Hofstra and I said that we’d done a lecture\nthere once with Viva. And he said that his little girls miss me, I met them in Colorado skiing. He was with his wife\nwho didn’t say anything. And then Sean saw that I had bluejeans on and he started saying, “You’re the only real\nperson here, you’re so cool, you’re so cool.” He’s so cute.\nAnd one of the waiters was somebody I’d discovered for Interview and he’d had a whole page as a bright\nyoung new star, he was in Jack Hofsiss’s play, and he went to L.A. for a year and now he’s back and being a waiter\n—it was really sad. I forget his name, although he told me again last night. From Georgia. Something like Bruce,\nmaybe. I dropped John Reinhold (cab $6). Got home at 12:30. Decided to read the Daily News and got to bed at\n2:00.\nAnd Yoko looks really good."

The 860 office said that Jean Michel was\nwaiting there, but I went to the new office and since I was high I terrorized everybody.\nWalked down to 860 and as we passed the new chic food place on 23rd Street a couple of black truck drivers\nyelled, “Hey faggots!” so that got me down. Especially because truck drivers are usually the ones who’re cheerful\nand recognize me and wave. Maybe these were faggots themselves.\nGot to the office and called Jean Michel and he came up and painted over a painting that I did, and I don’t\nknow if it got better or not.\nDropped Benjamin ($6). Glued myself, and cabbed to a dinner at Club A ($4). I was at a heavy-duty table next\nto Diane Von Furstenberg who’s having Michael Graves do her new store that’s next to Vieille Russie. And I told\nher not to count on a May opening, I told her how long it took Michael Graves to do John Reinhold’s apartment\nand I said he’d probably take her little store and divide it into fifteen rooms with forty columns in each, and then\nshe got scared. And she talked about a party she was giving for Michael Graves, but she didn’t invite me."

He was coughing for weeks and pneumonia’s really dangerous, you can go just like that. Before he went\ninto the hospital he was home for weeks, he said from a bad flu. He came in for a business lunch once, though, and\nI asked Gael why he had round little bandages on, and she said he’d just had moles removed, and that sounded\nreasonable.\nThen there was a lunch at the office for Charles Jourdan shoes (cab $6). Jay came to work glowing, he’s in love\nwith our fashion editor, Kate Harrington. And I said I thought she was going with John Sykes of MTV, and Jay\nsaid, “Listen, she broke up with him the day she met me,” so I mean I didn’t want to get into that. Kate has eyes\nfor everyone. She’s so bubbly, so pretty. Let’s hope Jay stays in this good mood. And Jean Michel was after Kate,\ntoo—she styled an Interview shoot of him and de Antonio in Armani clothes and he left five joints for her.\nVictor called a couple of times and now he always brings up that I said he could be dangerous and he always\nmentions Valerie Solanis. He’s staying at the Barbizon now, he said Halston’s changing the locks. He thinks\nVictor’s stealing his Peretti candlesticks, but actually he just borrowed them to leave with the Barbizon as a\nsecurity deposit. Victor gave me two at Christmas, but that was with Halston there and it was only on the condition\nthat Halston could get more of them. If he couldn’t, then I was supposed to give them back. But Tiffany does have\nmore of them—I checked."

      "text": "I was up in New Hampshire just over the Massachusetts border in Hampton Beach with Jon’s old friend Katy\nDobbs, near where Jon’s family has a beach house. Katy talks a mile a minute so it made things easier. It was so\nbeautiful up there, I want to get a house there, too. It’s like Montauk. On the ocean. But they’ve put in bigger\nwindows so the whole view is a window. And they’re winterizing the houses up there. And it was too hard to put\nthe curtains down so I left them up so the sun woke me up every morning really early. I was reading the Ned\nRorem diaries while I was up there. From the sixties to ‘71. He missed the whole scene that we were part of,\nthough— he was back in the elegant forties and fifties still. He puts me down a couple of times, I guess.\nIt was Easter and we went to see a friend of Katy’s. Fred, her boyfriend who’s on the Nickelodeon cable TV\nchannel, was in Tennessee for a whistling contest. He’s so talented and cute. They call him “Andy” because he\nlooked like me with white hair—the Phil Donahue look—but after meeting me and seeing how old I actually am,\nnow they call him “Son of Andy.” He did the voices for two of the gremlins in the new Spielberg movie and he got\n$500 a day. That’s not much. Three days’ work. The gremlins are forty minutes of the movie.\nOh, and on Easter services, they got up at 4:30 to go, but I couldn’t go. I didn’t want to go because I would feel\ntoo peculiar in a church where they might see me praying and kneeling and crossing myself because I cross the\nwrong way, I cross the Orthodox way. And they would be looking.\nThen when they came back we took a ride and then went to Jon’s family’s house for lunch. They had about ten\npeople. Lunch was outside. They have Christmas-tree kind of trees. The twin brothers, Jon and Jay, were both\nwearing bright green pants. They’re all macho but they like to freak for the weekend. The brother just broke up\nwith a beautiful model who lives in New York who I met once. He’s in his father’s business. Insurance. He just\nbought a house of his own up there.\nI haven’t heard anything about Robert Hayes.\nNed Rorem met Anais Nin just so he could be in her diary and she could be in his. And I want to do that, too—I\nwant to find somebody else who does a diary now so we can be in each other’s. And also in the morning the Easter\nBunny came and I ate chocolates in bed. And then it was time to get a ride to Boston and get the shuttle to New\nYork (tickets $171, magazines and newspapers $5)."

I\nthought Manhattan was built on the stuff that wouldn’t have it.\nSo my face broke out in pimples, I was being paid back for not going to church on Easter. And I was supposed\nto go on Monday, but then I went to Seaman Schepps instead. To look at a bracelet. Benjamin and I wandered\naround in the rain and the Interviews always look so awful when they get wet.\nI still have a pain in my side and so I’ve changed my appointments with Dr. Linda Li to Tuesday so I won’t\nhave that and shiatsu on the same day, and I haven’t gone to Doc Cox yet about the pain because I’m hoping it’s a\nmuscle spasm or something, but if it’s not, I’m a goner.\nCabbed downtown ($7). Called Jean Michel and he came up and ordered Chinese food from a place on Sixth\nAvenue. And then Keith Haring wanted me to go and see his paintings before they got shipped out, because he said\nI influenced him—he’s painting on canvas now. So we ate Chinese food and things from Pie in the Sky.\nVictor called and invited me to a small birthday party for Halston’s niece, and it’s Halston’s birthday, too.\nAnd Robert Hayes is a little better, his temperature went down.\nDropped Benjamin ($7), went home, got dressed, then (laughs) crashed a dinner. It was for Shirley MacLaine\nand I thought I was invited but it turns out I wasn’t. I mean, I’d had Brigid call and she said, “Cocktails at 7:30 and\ndinner at 8:30.” So when I got to the Limelight at 9:00 (cab $6) the doorman said, “Oh my, you’re awfully early,\naren’t you?” And I said, “But I’m invited to dinner,” and he said, “Oh, oh, sorry.” And then we went in and dinner\nwas just starting. The guy said, “Excuse me, Mr. Warhol, let me just go check something,” and then he came back\nand said, “Sorry Mr. Warhol, yes, it’ll be all right.” So I still didn’t know I was crashing. But I mean, finally I was\ngetting the idea, because it was really intimate. Only like thirty people. Bella Abzug was there and later on Iris\nLove and Liz Smith came in. The theme of the party was “white” and Liz was in a white tuxedo and Iris talked to\nme about the dogs because that’s all we have in common, and I just had a white turtleneck on but everybody else\nwas in white tuxedos. And the food was really good. Exotic. A vegetable that I never saw before that looked like\ncrinkled-up green beans. And some perfumed lamb that was interesting. And everybody gave speeches. I was the\nonly one who didn’t give a speech.\nAnd her daughter was sort of pretty, Shirley’s, she looks like Penelope Tree sort of, and she gave Shirley a kiss\non the lips. And Bella got up and made a feminist speech, and her husband got up and then a three-tier wedding\ncake came out, and Shirley gave her dramatic speech. And then there was coconut ice cream. And Shirley came\naround and she patted me on the shoulder like a dog and said, “Hello there, Andy.” Then finally it was time for me\nto leave and go to Halston’s.\nCabbed up to 63rd Street ($8). Halston’s niece is really pretty now. And Halston handed me a piece of paper in\nthe shape of a boat and I was so thrilled, I knew it was the rent check for $40,000. So that made my evening. And\nsince it was so rainy I didn’t have any gifts with me so I wrote an I.O.U. to Halston and Victor and the niece.\n“I.O.U. One Art.” Liza said that Mark’s only doing his artwork now, that he’s stopped producing plays and now\nhe’s just working at his studio on Prince Street. So I guess he must be having an affair down there. She said he’s\nalmost ready to have a show.\nSo anyway I went home and I opened up the paper boat and instead of a check, it was just nothing—like\n“Happy Birthday” or something. It wasn’t a check and it should have been a check. All done up like a boat. It\nshould’ve been a check."

She\nputs her hand on her cunt and pokes me in the gut through to the other side, and throws my whole body around.\nShe said she’s never dropped a patient, but I could’ve been the first. She has control over your body. She’s not bad-\nlooking. So I was there for a half-hour being tossed around. Then phone calls ($.50).\nJay’s still cheerful, so I guess his affair with Kate is still okay. I went over to Yanna’s for further beautification.\nI went past the cops at the Police Academy, and the girl cops are cute, they’re not like dykes now."

And now he takes these photographs\nall day, I see him even in odd locations, like on 43rd and Lexington shooting people coming out of Grand Central.\nHe’s so meek and skinny, and he rides his bike, and you never see him eat or drink at these parties.\nCabbed to meet Lidija at 860 ($5). The place was emptying out. They were moving stuff up to 33rd Street all\nday. Worked all afternoon. Rupert came up and now he’s meeker. Went to meet Jon at East-West for dinner (cab\n$10)."

Then, since\nI had to go to the Doc’s at 3:00 I couldn’t eat because I was going to have tests. But we wandered around and I had\na lot of energy because of the vitamins.\nJean Michel came down to the office early. He was reading his big review in the Voice. They called him the\nmost promising artist on the scene. And at least they didn’t mention me and say he shouldn’t be hanging around\nwith me the way the New York Times thing did.\nI opened up one of the boxes in the back that’s being moved and it had 16mm rolls of film and letters from Ray\nJohnson the artist and I think my bloodstained clothes from when I was shot.\nI realized that the reason Tony Shafrazi hasn’t gotten even one of the artists in his gallery into MOMA is\nbecause Tony’s the person who defaced Picasso’s “Guernica.” But that’s not fair. Keith Haring isn’t at MOMA.\nAnd they just have one thing of mine, the little Marilyn. I just hate that. That bothers me.\nThen in the afternoon I went to Doc Cox’s (cab $7) and I protested over the thermometer that they used,\nbecause it just sits there in water and everybody uses it, it’s not right. And Rosemary took my blood pressure, but I\nhave the feeling they just throw these tests out. Bubbles was tan. And they have a new heart machine so now I\ndon’t have to run up and down the stairs in the hallway (laughs) to get my heart going—it’s a big improvement.\nAnd Freddy won’t take your blood if she doesn’t know you.\nWe went to meet Paige and Benjamin ($4). And after dinner ($120) at Hisae and drinks at Jezebel’s ($30) we\nwent over to Stuart Pivar’s because he was having people over and I wanted to learn about art. I brought a small\nbronze with me that I just bought, three inches, and Stuart said it was a piece of junk, so tomorrow I’m returning\nit. I had it on consignment.\nAnd did I tell the Diary that Benjamin and I ran into Virginia Dwan and her daughter who’s married to Anton\nPerrich who did all those videos and rented our old floor at 33 Union Square West when we moved out. They said\nAnton was home with his painting machine and I was so jealous. My dream. To have a machine that could paint\nwhile you’re away. But they said he had to be there while it painted because (laughs) it clogs up. Isn’t that funny?"

She smokes\nconstantly, though. She’s moving out of that apartment in the Village. I guess she lost the case. She sublet it and\nhad Jed do all that work but she never had any signed agreement with the person. And I think Jed really warned\nher but she didn’t listen. So now she’s moving up to the Osborne across from Carnegie Hall. She was wearing\nblack tie but without the tie.\nI put a lamb chop in a napkin for the dogs and got blood on my pocket. Dinner was over at 10:30.\nThen Jean Michel was waiting down at Odeon (phone $.90, cab $10). And the Fischl guy came over and said\nthat as he was leaving the house, he had the TV show College Bowl Championships on, and I was the answer to a\nquestion and that the girl from the University of Minnesota got it in a second. It was, “Who painted Marilyn\nMonroe?” And I saw the dyke from Artforum who made me do all that free work—doing an original Dollar Sign,\nand then in the same issue she let some guy write the worst review of me that’s ever been in the magazine.\nThen we went over to Area and the theme was “Red.” And Jean Michel’s girlfriend Suzanne was there, the tiny\nmakeup artist. And Shawn Hausman, one of the owners—he’s Diane Varsi’s son—was on a ladder, I thought it was\npart of the exhibit but he was fixing a fuse. Shawn told me that Eric Goode told him that he’s so awed when he\nsees me that he gets goosebumps.\nAnd Fred’s been going out with Joan Collins who I guess is having a fling with Mick Flick.

Jill Fuller picked me up outside in a limo and we went to see the\nPink Floyd guy perform at the Beacon Theater.\nAnd then afterwards there was a dinner that Lorne Michaels was giving at Cafe Luxembourg, so we went over\nthere.

All the beauties must’ve been\nshopping in Soho or out on Fire Island, ‘cause they sure weren’t in this parade. And there were guys in\nwheelchairs being pushed by their lovers. I’m serious!

Richard Bernstein was there and he made me feel terrible—he said he\nwent to see Robert Hayes in the hospital and they all had to wear masks. And he’s also been to see Peter Lester\nand Peter’s got the kind of AIDS with spots. Richard said Robert looked terrible but that Peter Lester looked great\nexcept that he had a shirt on to cover the spots.\nOh and I had to call Doc Cox’s office to find out the results of my tests, so finally I braced myself and decided\nto be brave and that if it was anything horrible I’d just take it in stride. So I called and they said nothing was\nwrong. After all that drama they made, and then nothing was wrong. So I hung up feeling that health sure was\nwealth.\nSo anyway, Grace was just great, she’s a real presence. She had a big acting scene where she sees a mouse and\ngets hysterical, which is so stupid."

So we cabbed to the Penta Hotel ($5). It’s the hotel that\nwas called the Statler Hilton until last week or something and now it’s the Penta. But the cab wouldn’t go near the\nplace because of the mobs for Michael, so he let us off and we had to walk.\nFinally we found the place, we got Elevator B and went up, and Calvin was there, and he was mad that he’d\ncome so early. And Marina Schiano was with him and his girlfriend Kelly. And Rosanna Arquette, the actress,\ncame up and was so sweet, and I asked her if we’d ever done anything on her in Interview and she said, “No, and\nyou’ve just got to!” But then I remembered that we had done something—but just a “First Impression.” Little Sean\nLennon was there and that was exciting. And then this apparition appeared and it was Michael Jackson.\nSusan Blond pushed me into his arms and he was shy, and then people pushed me away, and Keith gave him T-\nshirts and everybody was meeting everybody and then I was pushed back at him and it was anticlimactic and then\nit was over. I shook his hand and it was like foam rubber. The sequined glove isn’t just a little sequined glove, it’s\nlike a catcher’s mitt. Everything has to be bigger than life for the stage.\nWe went to the show and it was laser beams and a movie where a sword had to be pulled out of a stone and\nMichael pulled it out. Bianca arrived late and the Jackson father was in her seat and she didn’t know who he was\nand tried to kick him out, but Susan Blond got up and gave her her seat.\nAnd then after the concert we called Mr. Chow’s to see if they’d be open and they said yes, that they had\nleftover food. And at Mr. Chow’s we were next to Anthony Quinn and he said hi and I didn’t know if I should go\nover to his table, I never know, so I played it shy, but then when he was leaving he came over and sort of hugged\nme, and I remembered that he’s an artist, that he paints."

And it was one of those parties where the\nbouncers were all dumb Mafia-type guys who didn’t know anybody. Jean\nMichel took us to the wrong section and they told us to beat it, and he said,\n“Now you see how it is to be black.” And all the people who I don’t know,\nJean Michel’s just sitting there and then he’ll say, “Hi, man.” He went to\nschool with them or something. He told me he went to a school in\nBrooklyn, St. Ann’s, that’s sort of chic because you had to pay. And then he\nsaid that when his father lost money he had to be bussed to a public school\nthat was a lot of Italians and the boys there used to beat him up and he\ndidn’t like it. But I guess the education was good, though, and that’s why\nhe’s smart.\nThen we got to the VIP room and it was like a remake of an old party.\nJanet Villella was there and Linda Stein, and it was free drinks (tip $10).\nThen they came in and told everybody to leave and get out because\nJermaine was coming in, and that we could come back later, that (laughs)\nsome of us would be selected to come back. There were some sort of drag\nqueens there with jewelry on, and so we all had to get out, it was so stupid.\nAnd you have to walk for a block to get to the next room. And the\nphotographers there are so bored with seeing me, they don’t even say hi\nanymore. Hold on, the other line’s ringing….\nOh gee, that was Benjamin calling and he said that he and Paige were at\nthe Limelight and they heard I was in the VIP room and they tried to get in\nbut couldn’t. And—this is funny— he said that there were three Olympic\nguys there wearing their gold medals. So I guess those were the ones I\nthought were drag queens with jewelry! Gee.\nSo anyway, Jean Michel wanted me to see his paintings down on Great\nJones Street, so we went there and it’s a pigsty. His friend Shenge—this\nblack guy—lives with him and he’s supposed to be taking care of the place,\nbut it’s a sty. And the whole place just smells so much of pot. He gave me\nsome paintings to work on. Left there (cab $8)."

Dr. Li said that she’d been at the Michael Jackson thing and I was\nsurprised. Then I put it together—Benjamin had said he saw Roberta Flack\nat the concert, and Dr. Li has a picture of Roberta Flack in her office, so I\nasked her if she was with Roberta Flack, and she said yes. So now I’m\ntrying to figure out if they could be dykes.\nThen cabbed to the Whitney where there was the lunch for the\npresentation by Ethel Scull of the portrait of her that I did in the sixties (cab\n$4). They were serving lunch in front of the painting.\nEthel hadn’t arrived yet and when they called her she was in the bath,\nshe thought the lunch was Tuesday. Finally she arrived in a wheelchair and\na hat with the big cast on her leg. It was so sad. Like a movie moment\nwhere everybody’s waiting. The painting’s not very good, even. It was just\n—I don’t know. And she said all these things about how I’d wanted $1,200\ncash for the painting. In cash, she said, and I mean, I don’t remember that—\nI wouldn’t have even discussed money. I can’t even do it now, so I can’t see\nmyself saying, “I want $1,200 cash.” It must have been one of the Bellamy\nGallery people or Ivan Karp or something who got paid. And she said she\ncame to my house and my mother answered the door, but why would my\nmother answer the door if I was expecting somebody—I’d be right there. I\ndon’t know, it was nutty.\nAnd I ran into one of the old kids from Max’s and they told me they\nfinally read Edie over the weekend and that they weren’t shocked by the\ndrugs or anything anybody said about me—that the only thing that shocked\nthem in it was reading that I sold some of my early films to somebody, that\nthey couldn’t believe I wouldn’t be keeping them for myself. But, see, I\ndidn’t really sell them—I have them back now, the guy’s contract expired.\nOh, it’s all Fred’s fault that I’m in that book. He kept after me to talk to\nJean Stein. Because she was “social,” my dear, and was having parties. So\nme talking to her made it look like I sanctioned her book.\nSo it was so boring and gee it’s such a sad family—Ethel doesn’t speak\nto her sons. David Whitney gave us a tour of the Fairfield Porter show,\nthough, and I looked at Mondrian, and he just took tape and painted it and\nthen Sidney Janis owned these things and it became a business.\nThen at 3:00 went downtown (cab $6). Drue Heinz called to wish me a\nhappy birthday. So did some other people. I got a big twelve-foot weed\nfrom Renny the florist.\nPaige picked out a place to have dinner and I invited Jay but then he\ncalled back and Benjamin got the phone and Jay asked would I mind if he\nbrought Kate Harrington, and I didn’t say anything, and then he asked\nBenjamin, “Did Andy just make a face?” He just wanted to start trouble. He\ndoes these things so people will feel guilty when he doesn’t want to come\nanyway. But Benjamin was great, he just said, “Here’s the address—if you\nwant to come, come.” And I would have yelled at Kate if she came, since\nshe’d left work at Interview that afternoon saying she was sick.\nWell, we went to 79th and Lexington to this place called Jams that we\ngo by all the time and never knew was there, this chic place. It was\nexpensive, but the food was so good. The whole thing was like the Four\nSeasons used to be when the guy was there who used to grow the garden\nstuff in his own patch in Connecticut. The dessert was incredible. Jean\nMichel ordered a lot of champagne and he said he’d pay for it but I\nwouldn’t let him (dinner was $550). It was underplayed, nobody said\n“Happy Birthday” and it went smoothly. Paige had a strapless pink dress on\nand she took her camera into the kitchen to do movies. Jean Michel dropped\nme off and it seemed like being with Jean Michel didn’t bother Paige too\nmuch, she’s more recovered from him. Then when he was dropping me off\nhe said that he wanted to go fuck her. I told him that that would just start\ntrouble again. I told him he should give her some artwork because she’s the\nonly girl who ever really helped him out, gave him his first uptown show\nand sold so many of his paintings. And she never would let him pay for her,\nshe was being very independent, paying her own fare to Hawaii and things\nlike that, and I don’t know why he never liked that, somehow.\nAnd it was nice to see little Suzanne the makeup girl the night before at\nLimelight wanting not to get stuck with him—it was refreshing to see a girl\ntrying to get away for a change."

She says she’s about to star\nopposite Jack Nicholson in something that I didn’t get the name of because\nI felt I should know it. And she just got married to this guy, Jay, and they’re\na funny couple. He’s about my height but with heels on she was taller than\nhim. He started out in Lance Loud’s band the Mumps, and then he worked\nfor his father and then he went into business with this friend of his and\nbought all these real estate properties in the slump of ‘74 when they were\ncheap and he became a millionaire.\nAnd Richard had a girl there who was like Judy Holliday, but dumb for\nreal. Really dumb. I haven’t met a girl like this for a long, long time. I don’t\nknow where she would come from. She was an airline stewardess. She said\nto me, “Gee you look peculiar,” and they said, “He’s an artist,” and she said,\n“I have a sister who’s an artist, yeah, and she looks peculiar like you, too.”\nAnd then she asked me if I did something to my hair. And then Richard\ntook her upstairs to talk to her."

      "text": "I made up some things for Sean Lennon’s birthday and the painting was still\nwet—a little heart candy-box that said “I love you”—and I also brought a\n“paint brush” that instead of bristles had strips of red colored paper in a\nstack. And a bracelet I’d made out of pennies. PH picked me up and we\nwent to the Dakota (cab $6.50). There were fans outside in honor of the day\nstill on the “vigil.” Because the ninth is Sean and John’s birthday. Inside\nYoko’s door everybody had taken their shoes off so there was a line of\nshoes. I wouldn’t take mine off, though, and I didn’t want PH to, either, so\nthat I wouldn’t be alone. PH said that when she went to the Royal Palace\nonce in Hawaii that the tour guides gave you booties to put over your shoes\nand that would be a better way to keep the house clean, I think. So then\nwhen we heard a glass drop and break, that was our excuse—that we didn’t\nwant to be in our socks when there might be glass. Yoko ran to call Sean\nand he came in and said, “Did you bring my dollar?” Yoko said that he’d\nbeen remembering and wanting the other half of the dollar I tore in half the\nlast time. So I gave him a whole bunch of torn bills that I’d brought for him\nand he went off to try to find the match to the half he had. Keith was there\nand he brought Kenny Scharf as his date. Walter Cronkite was there, and\nJohn Cage and Louise Nevelson and Lisa Robinson.\nOn purpose for fun I had spelled Sean’s name “Shawn” on a couple of\nhis gifts, and so when Sean autographed napkins for me he signed it that\nway, too. He was wearing Michael Jackson-type gloves, but on both hands,\nthat his friend little Max Leroy, Warner Leroy’s son, had given him.\nMichael Jackson is his favorite singer. He said he likes Prince, too, and he\nmust like Boy George, too, because later on his computer he did a drawing\nof Boy George. Sean and Keith hit it off. Keith is very good playing with\nkids—he was playing really well with another baby that was there, too,\ncoming after her with a stuffed animal. Sean sat between me and Roberta\nFlack.\nThe cake was a big blond grand piano. Sean was the one who had the\nidea that it should be a piano. He has a piano in his bedroom. And he cut the\ncake. Harry Nilsson led everyone singing “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,”\nand later Sean made a really nice speech and said that if his father were\nthere we’d be singing ‘Tor They’re Jolly Good Fellows”\nAfter dinner Yoko and Sean and some of the people went over to the\nWNEW broadcast that they were originally going to do inside the building,\nbut at the last minute the Dakota wouldn’t let them. But most of the people\nstayed behind. We went into Sean’s bedroom—and there was a kid there\nsetting up the Apple computer that Sean had gotten as a present, the\nMacintosh model. I said that once some man had been calling me a lot\nwanting to give me one, but that I’d never called him back or something,\nand then the kid looked up and said, “Yeah, that was me. I’m Steve Jobs.”\nAnd he looked so young, like a college guy. And he told me that he would\nstill send me one now. And then he gave me a lesson on drawing with it. It\nonly comes in black and white now, but they’ll make it soon in color. And\nthen Keith and Kenny used it. Keith had already used it once to make a T-\nshirt, but Kenny was using it for the first time, and I felt so old and out of it\nwith this young whiz guy right there who’d helped invent it.\nSean’s bedroom had two mattresses on the floor and lots of Beatles\npictures and the big Rupert Smith picture of Yoko on the wall. There was\nwrapping paper and presents all over the floor, and lots of robot toys on the\nshelves.\nAfter we left I was so blue because before I was Sean’s best grownup\nfriend and now I think Keith is. They really hit it off. He invited Keith to his\nparty for kids the next day and I don’t think I was invited and I’m hurt."

I was sort of glad that I didn’t bring Cornelia, because she’d be “a\nthreat” to Jerry. I was surprised to see Whitney Tower there because Jerry\nalways accused him of getting girls for Mick.

She must’ve\nknown how rich he was. Or else maybe he was good-looking. Because he\ndid also say that Pablo Picasso once saw him and wanted to do his portrait,\nand said he’d do two and give him one, but he thought it was just some old\nguy after his body. This was on the beach. But I don’t know if his stories are\ntrue.

He’s not happier now that he’s uptown because it’s all\nbefore him now and he doesn’t know what to do. I told him, “Look, those\ntantrums weren’t real anyway.” He’s confused. Stayed till 11:30."

But he owns Technicolor or\nsomething. So I was trying to get myself invited to the wedding.\nGerry Grinberg from North American Watches came for lunch. He said\nthat the economy isn’t good. I guess people aren’t buying watches. He said\npeople were buying more expensive gifts but only for themselves. Bob\nDenison only sent me half of what he sent me the year before, but then Park\nAvenue does have five times more trees planted on it than last year.\nEizo, my shiatsu massager, wrote me a note thanking me for introducing\nhim to Yoko Ono. She wants to see him every day, but he can’t do that, and\nanyway your body needs a week to rest. He’s doing little Sean tomorrow.\nAnd Eizo’s wife’s poetry teacher wrote me a Pop poem that I don’t know\nwhat to do with. It’s like, “I touch you and you touch me and we have\nfeelings.” And you really learn all the gossip about everybody through this\nshiatsu network. Eizo told me that Yoko’s boyfriend Sam has a soft body.\nAnd he said Yoko’s been sick and has a bad back.\nAnd then went to 990 Fifth Avenue to the party Judy Peabody was\ngiving for Peter Allen. I was talking to this art student and suddenly Peter\ncame over and said to him, “I’m leaving and you’re coming with me!” He\nthought I was stealing his boyfriend! Can you imagine? That’s the first time\nthat’s ever happened to me. So I didn’t know what to do, but then I guess\nPeter felt silly because later he was trying to entertain me. I left at 12:30,\nthe party was just getting going."

Julian was\nputting down de Kooning and I said oh no, that he was wrong, that de\nKooning was a great painter, and then finally Clemente said yes, that he\nreally was.\nThomas Ammann called and said that it was really cold in Switzerland.\nBruno wants me to go there for Jean Michel’s opening. Someone was\nsaying that when all these dealers heard there was a really talented black\nartist who would probably die off soon from drugs, that they hurried to buy\nhis things and now I guess they’re frustrated because he’s staying alive.

And then\nI asked him where he got his bracelet, and he said, “Teepee Town.” And I\nsaid, “Teepee Town went out of business.” And he said, “No, it just moved\noff 42nd Street—now it’s in the Port Authority bus terminal.” And then he\ntold me to put my urine in this little bottle. And I just could think that he\nprobably goes to the Port Authority and collects urine in bottles. He’s about\n6’6” and his eyes are weird, like a little brain-damaged or milky. He took\nmy blood pressure and did my heart. It was the most fun part of the day.\nWorked till 7:30."

I’m on the\nfloor now, still, with the phone, being a martyr.\nSo then I was working on the Joan Collins portrait and on some other\nstuff, and then a big four-page telegram came from The Love Boat saying\nthat they wanted to show all my art on The Love Boat, too. The story is that\nI go on The Love Boat and there’s a girl on the boat named Mary with her\nhusband, and she used to be a superstar of mine, and she doesn’t want her\nhusband to know that she used to be “Marina Del Rey.” And I just have a\nfew lines, things like “Hello, Mary.” But one of the lines I have to say is\nsomething like “Art is crass commercialism,” which I don’t want to say.\nPH will be in L.A. then, too, so we can do some work there on the Party\nbook—photograph the Academy Awards and the Love Boat thing. I’ll be at\nthe Bel Air.\nThen went to the Whitney for the opening of the Biennial and waited\noutside for Jean Michel. He had a new smile on his face. We went\ndownstairs and upstairs and saw Kenny Scharf and his wife and it was wall-\nto-wall four floors. And a woman stopped Jean Michel and was raving and\nraving about him saying, “This is my favorite artist. My husband and I,\nyou’re our favorite artist,” and I’m standing there, and I offer her an\nautographed Interview and she says, “No.”\nThen we went down to this place on Eighth Avenue and 14th Street,\nwhere Jean Michel gets rice and beans, just one of those dirty ratholes that I\nsay I would never eat in, but it was so good that I did.\nAnd then we called up Paul, the exercise trainer who works for Lidija,\nand we were right near his apartment which is right off Abingdon Square\ndown there, a nice neighborhood, and so we went over there, and God, it’s\nso strange when you finally see where a person lives, and it’s just so … I\nmean, it’s this one room, and he’s been subletting it for a year or so, and\nnow the woman who he sublet it from is back and she’s about forty, and like\na hippie who wants to get backing for a restaurant, and their beds are just\nlike next to each other, and they aren’t in the apartment at the same time,\nlike you feel you can’t go home when the other one is there, so you feel like\nyou’re not really living anyplace I guess that that’s when your life is really\ninteresting, though, because it keeps you out there in action and getting into\nweird situations. But I mean, I go from that, and then I come back up here\nto (laughs) this, it’s so abstract. You know? But I don’t understand why he\ncould leave the place like such a dump. They should just get futons and not\nwaste space with the beds. And it would really only have taken a couple of\nhours to pick the place up once while she was gone in Europe all that time.\nAnd then we went to Area. Jean Michel has the right walk to pass right\nthrough the crowd. He made me go to the bathroom there, the men’s room,\nand it’s so funny there, there are girls putting on makeup in the mirrors and\nthe men are pissing in the urinals and it’d be great if it weren’t that it\nsmelled like shit. It’s just my kind of movie. I guess the ladies room is the\nsame way except without the urinals. Then I got out of there and went\nhome. Oh, and that lady at the Whitney who was so thrilled over Jean\nMichel, she got him to sign a picture of the painting. That’s as good as\nsigning it, and then you paste it to the back. That’s why Leo sends me up\nphotographs sometimes."

We looked at one big elephant that’s $800,000 and there’s\none for $1 million and one for $400,000. So that took a long time.\nThen it was the night of the big Love Boat Thousandth Guest Star party\nat the Beverly Hilton. Fred was taking Rupert Everett but at the last minute\nRupert cancelled, he said, “My tuxedo is crumpled.” And Jon picked me up\nand we went over there. Had my picture taken for fifteen minutes with Joan\nCollins, who then never went in to the dinner, I don’t think, because nobody\nsaw her in there. But it was just packed.\nOne of Aaron Spelling’s daughters was at our table, in her teens or\ntwenties, and Troy Donahue who now has short blond-white hair. I\nreminded him of that time in the early seventies when he came up to 33\nUnion Square. He said, “What you guys did to me that day! Your elevator\nwas broken so I had to go up in the freight elevator in the back, and it\nopened into this dark room where you were screening a movie and I had to\nwalk out from behind the projection screen, and everybody was facing the\nscreen watching movies, and I stumbled over everybody sitting on the floor\nin the dark, and I was on acid….”\nThey introduced a lot of stars and then finally out came Lana Turner, the\nthousandth guest star, who had given them a hard time by being so late, and\nthat’s why dinner was late. And then they brought me up on the stage with\nCarol Channing and Ginger Rogers and Mary Martin. And for some reason\nthey didn’t mention the portrait they commissioned me to do of Lana. But\nit’s finally scheduled for me to shoot the picture on Thursday.\nPeter Duchin’s orchestra played. He’s another one of the guest stars on\nthe boat this week. So it’s Peter Duchin, Tom Bosley, Marion Ross, Cloris\nLeachman, Andy Griffith, Raymond St. Jacques, Milton Berle, and me.\nAnd signed a lot of autographs for the kooky autograph hounds of\nHollywood. PH and I both took pictures for the Party book."

And Fred had already gone to dinner at Sue\nMengers’s, so I followed, and Barbra Streisand was there and she was\ndropping names like Archipenko, the sculptor, and she said that Steve Ross\nsends them to her, sends her all these valuable things after she admires them\nin his place. And she asked how much a portrait was, and I said I just\ncouldn’t talk about price, and she asked Fred and he said $25,000 and she\nsaid, “Oh really? So cheap?” And she turned to her Baskin-Robbins\nboyfriend, and said, “Maybe we should buy one for Steve.”\nBarbra’s really skinny but she had three helpings of curry. And she looks\ngreat. She has her hair straight now and her dress showed everything in the\nright way. But I think this boyfriend is the one who directed the horrible\nvideo for the song she has out now, “Emotion,” but I’m not sure. And she’s\nsuing her building in New York because of the roof—it leaks. It’s at 92nd\nand Central Park West and she didn’t even remember that she’d invited me\nto a party there, this was about seven or nine years ago—Jed and I went—\nand she said, “I knew you? Were you famous then, when you came to my\nparty?” As if she would’ve invited me if I weren’t. And I felt like telling\nher, “Yes I was there, and you had name tags stuck on all the food like a\ndelicatessen— ‘chopped liver’ and ‘gefilte fish,’ and I don’t know, ‘halvah.’\n“ It was getting to that point where I might as well have. I told her, “Oh\nyour jewelry is so small, Barbra, why don’t you get bigger things?” And she\nsaid, “Oy! I bought diamonds for $60,000 a carat and the next day they\ndropped to $20,000!” And it’s true, it really happened like that about three\nyears ago. But I told her that the day they went down to $20,000 she\nshould’ve bought three more and cut her losses. And Sean Connery was\nthere but I didn’t talk to him. And Alan Ladd, Jr., who looked sensational.\nAnd they all talk about Jews trying to be WASPs and they were talking\nabout Woody Allen and Mia Farrow and really putting down Mia."

The Spelling wife and Doug\nCramer and Lana.\nSo the car came and took us to Regent Air. It’s just $100 more than first\nclass. It’s $800. There were only fifteen people. And you really feel the\nturbulence on a small plane. On the 747s you don’t feel anything. The only\nfamous person was Mark Goodson. The rest were just grand types—a\nwoman who looked like Milton Berle and a guy with gold chains so he\nmust have been a Hollywood writer or something (tip $50). They’d showed\ntwo movies in succession on the flight—Protocol and The Cotton Club—\nand both of them weren’t hits, but you could see quality in them so it was\nsad. And the bathrooms on Regent are three times the size of a normal\nbathroom. And there was a girl with a portfolio, either a model or a whore\nor something, just bubbling and enthusiastic. And they come and scramble\nyour eggs right in front of you. When we arrived in New York the airline\nhad twenty limos waiting. Tipped the driver $20.\nSo got in and it was 6:00 in the evening in New York and that really\nthrows you off. I hate it. You’re dead tired but you feel like you have to\nhave your day. And you call people up but it’s Easter weekend and\neverybody’s out of town. But then the phone rang and it was Cornelia\ninviting me to dinner at Le Cirque with Jane Holzer.

The big cheese, Dr. Reese, was in town, and\nmy appointment was for 12:0 at Bernsohn’s—he was taking me to lunch\nwith Reese and they were going to do my cranium. I asked Reese how he\nstarted in crystals and he said that when he was little, “Mr. Morning” came\nto see him. When he was a baby. He saw “Mr. Morning,” but nobody else\ndid. And then in the army he got interested in electricity and the body and\nall this stuff. Reese was talking about his trip where he went around sticking\ncrystals all over the pyramids and the Wailing Wall. And he eats things like\ncoffee and doughnuts. But he cures the coffee by passing the crystal over it\nten times. And he says he knows somebody in South Africa who went to the\nWailing Wall who now wants to get his money out of South Africa and do\nmovies. Reese is Episcopalian, so I feel better with him than with the\nJewish crystal people, somehow, because knowing he believes in Christ I\ndon’t have to worry that crystals might be somehow against Christ. And his\nassistant —this girl—kept asking him, “Should we tell him? Should we tell\nhim what we want him to do?” And finally Reese said, “Yes.” So the girl\nsaid, “Your forces are with us. You’ve got to come to Tibet with us. You\nhave the ability to do great things.” And then they do talk about needing\npeople to support their studies. So do you think they’re going to ask me for\nmoney? That that’s it? Bernsohn is so materialistic—the new laser-beam\nrecord players and the new apartment. Then they tell me I was Chinese in\nmy other life and that I have to go to Tibet with them…. Look, I know the\npeople are ridiculous, but it’s the crystals I believe in. They do work. When\nyou think that these crystals were in the center of the earth and have all this\nenergy…\nOh, and I got a letter from my niece Eva in Denver that said, “God Bless\nYou, and by the way I stole your drawings ten years ago, do you want them\nback?” In like 1970 when she was living here and taking care of my mother.\nShe told me she rolled up some of my Flower prints and took them and\nthey’ve been in her basement.

Peter Max was just a businessman trying to be an artist. He\ncopied me a lot. And now he gets $100,000 for a portrait. Look. Here’s how\nit all works: You meet rich people and you hang around with them and one\nnight they’ve had a few drinks and they say, “I’ll buy it!” Then they tell\ntheir friends, “You must have his work, darling,” and that’s all you need. I\nmean, it’s like Schnabel sitting there with Philip Niarchos. That’s all it\ntakes. So you get your price established. Get it?"

She was selling a Bacon and she was upset with the low reserve, she\nsaid—$250,000. I guess she needs the money.

But\nI can’t stand the smells of those places—even the preppie Surf Club is\ntough to take.\nI got catalogues, and the painting I did of Happy Rockefeller, an early\none from ‘64, was up for sale. It’s estimated at $30,000 or $40,000, and if\nshe’d donated it to one of the museums she could’ve gotten a $500,000\nwriteoff because of the new prices, so I don’t know why she’s selling it.\nMaybe it’s the kids. She sold that Nelson Rockefeller one, too, months ago.\nAnd it’s Fashion Week and all around town, everyone’s just a beauty, it’s\nso depressing.\nOh, and Victor called me and I said he doesn’t come to visit, and he said\nhe’ll start coming tomorrow. He lives on 57th Street—he’s with somebody,\nhe’ll always get by, he still has his big dick.\nAnd I don’t know why Interview is having all these Bruce Weber\neditorial photos of naked people.

      "text": "The day of the opening night of the Palladium. The day started off with the\nproblem of Amos being sick. And then the guy painting the roof across the\nstreet came over and said mine needed doing. He got my name from the\nsuper over there, I guess, and I gave him the go-ahead to do it and he did it.\nThen he gave me a bill for $4,900. I hadn’t remembered to get an estimate.\nMy fault. Then I get a note from the neighbor saying my roof is now silver\nand that they just can’t stand looking at it. They’re telling the right guy,\nright? No silver. Anyway, I told him to repaint it and I asked him how much\nthat would be and he says it’ll take thirty gallons to spray it and it’ll cost\n$1,200. And he does it in five minutes. Five minutes! I thought it would\ntake hours. And then later he says $1,500 and I reminded him that he’d said\n$1,200 before.\nSo in the midst of all those problems, Benjamin picked me up early and\nwe cabbed to the office ($4) and the place is so big and spread-out, I ran up\nand down stairs, up and down and sideways up and down and sideways.\nThat’s my life there. That’s what I do for a living since we moved there.\nKeith showed up. We were waiting for Kenny Scharf to call to say if he\nwanted to go to Stephen Sprouse’s to get an outfit, but then he went on his\nown. He got pink Stephen Sprouse low-riders and wore them with a blouse\nmade by his wife, Teresa. But I don’t think it’s attractive, seeing the crack in\nthe ass. On girls either. I don’t like it, really.\nThen we picked up PH and went down with Keith to the Palladium and\nwent in the back door on 13th Street and the electricians and construction\npeople were working fast. We went up to Steve Rubell’s office and the\nphones were ringing and he was saying, “There’s no door list, the\ninvitations all were delivered yesterday and there is no list.” And in between\npeople were coming in with the list. Then I left after taping some more for\nthe Party book and taking some pictures. Dropped PH ($5). Went home and\nglued.\nPicked Cornelia up and she looked beautiful, she got this idea to wear a\nlong braid and she looked like Britt Ekland or something (cab $6). And\nHalston came out for this, that was a big thing. So, anyway, we went in and\nstood in a couple of places. And Benjamin was there as Ming Vauze in a\ngrape-colored strapless with a tulle skirt. And Beauregard who writes for\nDetails was in drag, too. Boy George was there with Marilyn who’s always\nobnoxious, she had a camera. Eric and Shawn from Area were there looking\nglum. Chris in a striped outfit was there, he was complaining that the drinks\nweren’t free, but Cornelia was getting the Cristal from Dan, Steve’s driver\nfrom New Hampshire, who’s now the “general manager” there, but I don’t\nthink that’s going to work out because he’s too nice, he’ll never be the type\nto manage a place.\nAnd Jean Michel was in a dark mood. He’d bought Jennifer a dress to\nwear to the opening and then he didn’t even bring her, he left her home.\nAnd I didn’t lecture him about the heroin he takes because I didn’t want to\nhave a fight. And I’m worried about Ming turning into an alcoholic,\nbecause I saw what happened with Curley—it starts very happy and lots of\nfun but it doesn’t end up that way. And the Palladium, I don’t know, it was\ngood for opening night but they’re going to have to have the bridge and\ntunnel people in there all the time to fill it up. And if it is a success, then\nwe’ll know there’s no recession.\nAnd the funny thing about putting art in a disco is that in the end, when\nyou pack all the people in, it doesn’t make a bit of difference. It really\ndoesn’t. You don’t even see things. And like that Saturday Night Fever\n“discotheque room” they have—when it filled up you couldn’t even see\nwhat it was supposed to be, it’s just all bodies dancing and you don’t notice\nwhat anything is.\nSo Steve Rubell really has a story now, jail and then the Big Comeback.\n“I never lost faith,” he says. But he lost hair. Left at 2:30."

Cornelia\nand Marilyn hit it off and instead of leaving with me she went off dancing\nwith them.\nThe food was pretty good—Glorious Food. But they don’t have the real\nbeauties for waiters anymore. You aren’t knocked out. Now they have sort\nof the thirty-five look. Somebody else must be picking them because they\nused to look like Steve Rubell had hand-picked them—that look.

And you know, when I was little I remember I was really\nsick and didn’t like school and had to be dragged there and then one day I\nchanged—after that I loved school and everything, so I think somebody\nmay have walked into me then…. I’m not clear on who the walk-ins are.\nSouls. And I’m not clear on where they come from."

Decided to stay out as\nlong as possible because it’d been a couple of days of me being cooped up,\nand it was a beautiful day. Went to Bagel Nosh ($10) and stood in line for\nscrambled eggs and it was so dirty but it was okay, I faced it. Wandered to\n46th Street. Saw the sights. Took pictures of drunken ladies sleeping on\npark benches and felt that life was just so awful. And I don’t know what I\ntry to look good for. Everybody when you look at them really close is so\nawful-looking. So animalistic.\nAnd then it was time to go to the opening of my Reigning Queens show\ndown on West Broadway and Greene Street. This is the show that George\nMulder got together. Some one-night Dutch benefit thing. Rupert’s “wife”\npicked us up in the Bentley and the missus was disgruntled. And then we\ngot down there and parked next to Victor’s limousine. Victor just got some\nkind of settlement from Halston. I think he had to sign a paper saying he\nwouldn’t talk about Halston ever, but I mean, what does that mean? He’s\nhappy now that he’s got this wad of money, but when it’s gone …\nAnd I’ve hit rock bottom. This show, I have sunk to the bottom of the\ngutter. The rock bottom of the skids of the end of the line. It was like having\nan opening in somebody’s rent-controlled apartment. I mean, they had a\npaper covering a mirror! And they had hors d’oeuvres that I think they were\nmaking in the kitchen. And these Dutch TV people were all around. It was\nso lowdown and tacky. Fred wasn’t there. He’d already left, didn’t want to\nface me, I guess he was in shock. We found him dazed, wandering along\nChristopher Street later on, on his way up to the Ballroom for the Scavullo\nbenefit for the church in Greenwich Village. We just ran into him on a fluke\nand gave him a ride.\nSo we left there and went up to the Scavullo thing and I sat down but\nthen Cornelia was screaming that there was a fashion show and that I was\nsupposed to be in it, so somebody grabbed me and took me to the basement,\nand it was every famous beautiful model and the tits were flying all over the\nplace. And I was in Stephen Sprouse, and Cornelia and I got the biggest\napplause. And Boy George was in the audience and Marilyn, and they said\nlet’s go to dinner, they had a limo, but I went in a cab anyway, up to Mr.\nChow’s (cab $6).\nIt was me and Benjamin and Boy George and Marilyn and Cornelia and\nCouri Hay and they all act like horrible brats—Couri screamed across the\nrestaurant to Dianne Brill, “Get your pussy over here,” and this is a place\nwith just regular people, and then Cornelia would say to somebody who’d\ntold them to please be quiet, “You look like a dried duck,” or something like\nthat. Just awful. And then Marilyn saw Mary Wilson sitting at a table and\nwent over and Benjamin just collapsed because she’s his favorite singer,\nand then she came over and thanked me for going to her comeback concert\na few years ago (dinner $400).\nAnd Boy George and Marilyn like me I think because they can say mean\nthings and then I’m not quick enough to think of a comeback, so I’m not a\nthreat to them."

And I brought up “walk-\nins” and told him how I think somebody might have walked into me when I\nwas shot, in addition to somebody maybe walked irto me when I was little.\nBut somehow these walk-in theories don’t make total sense to me. He said\nthat if your body is really weak and sick nobody will walk into it. And then\nI said, “But then people could be walking into you the rest of the time.” I\ndon’t get it yet.\nCabbed with Jon who’s back in town for a couple of days to 32nd Street\nto see Rambo.

Why didn’t Ritts\nat least have him hold a hanky in one shot or something, to establish that it\nwas our picture, not just some still from Rocky IV."

I\nthink he must have just gotten the job that Jon was wanting. I don’t know if\nJon would have been good at it. He never liked any of the projects I thought\nof, but now that he’s trying to go into production, I’m just waiting—I’ll\nprobably see my ideas being announced as his new projects. Like the\n“Music Hotel,” that one I was doing with Maura Moynihan. Jon always\nthinks it was his idea after the movie comes out. Like Footloose. He knew\nDean Pitchford, the friend of Peter Allen’s, and he remembered that they\nwere all talking about it at a party once and then after Dean Pitchford did it\nas a movie Jon would always say it’d been his idea, too.

So he went\nthere and it wasn’t there anymore. The Last Supper comes in small,\nmedium, and large. So then at this other place, I’d gotten the guy down\nfrom $2,500 to $1,000 for the medium. But Benjamin forgot we’d gotten\nthem down, and he bought the medium one for $2,000! He didn’t\nremember! It was actually the size I really wanted, anyway, but he wound\nup giving the second store for the medium one what he was supposed to\nbuy the large one for. So this means he hasn’t got a head for figures—a\nthousand dollars is a lot to waste. I just couldn’t believe it, after I’d haggled\nso hard.\nWent to Marylou’s on 9th Street for a models dinner (cab $5). Joey\nHunter was there.

She\nsaid she was leaving for L.A. Friday afternoon so we made a date to take\nthe picture at 11:00 on Friday morning, so I hope it works out.\nThey should be getting the Stallone issue in today. Everybody was\ntalking about the Stallone interview—they said he sounds smart. Is that\npossible?"

We rode in a limo out to\nMalibu and when we saw helicopters in the distance we knew we were at\nthe wedding. Somebody had tipped the reporters off about where the\nwedding was and about ten helicopters were hovering, it was like\nApocalypse Now. And one helicopter had a girl hanging off with a camera\nand they were all trying to get in close. And the security people found\ncamouflage-outfitted photographers in the bushes. And I looked really close\nat Madonna and she is beautiful. And she and Sean are just so in love. She\nwore white, and a black bowler hat, I don’t know what that was supposed to\nmean. And someone said that Sean had shot at the helicopters the night\nbefore. The only boring celebrity there was Diane Keaton, really. And it\nwas the right mixture of nobodies and celebrities. Sean came over to say\nhello, and the good-looking family of Madonna was there, all the brothers.\nAnd you can see Madonna and Sean love each other so much. Really, it was\nthe most exciting thing ever.\nAnd at the wedding Steve Rubell was really out of it on I guess\nQuaaludes. And I think I saw Madonna kick him away from her and later he\nthrew up in the car. She was dancing with the only little boy there. And you\ncould see everybody who was there, it was under a tent, it wasn’t too\ncrowded. And those young actors seemed like they were in their fathers’\nsuits, like Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise. All those movie-star boys with\nthe strong legs who’re 5’10” or so. I guess that’s the new Hollywood look.\nLike the actors in Matthew Rolston’s big photo spread in the Stallone issue.\nHave I said how great that looked? Matthew is our best photographer now\n—he uses good locations and gives the kids “a look.” He made these new\nkids look stunning—like stars—he gave them all class. Oh, and as we were\nleaving I just couldn’t believe my eyes because Tom Cruise jumped into our\ncar to get away from photographers. His car was down the road. I took a\npicture of him.\nFred and I thought Marisa’s wedding was more glamorous, but this one\nwas spectacular because of the helicopters."

I don’t know how a\ngirl could manage in it—I wasn’t doing too well myself. There was no light.\nBut they had a new gadget in there, I think it might have been a hairdryer.\nOr maybe it was just a phone. And the security at the Beverly Hills looks\nlike it— at the Bel Air they just blend in.\nSteve Rubell decided not to go over with us to see Dolly Parton. He\nstayed in bed and made phone calls. You know, it’s odd to watch Steve,\nbecause it’s like he’s trying so hard to be “a character.” Like the way he eats\nhis ketchup and his Coca-Cola and he repeats over and over that these are\nthe things he likes and that this is the way he likes them. So that people will\nremember him as “a character.” It’s like he might have read a book on how\nto be remembered and make an impression and he’s doing everything it\nsaid. He’ll order the food and then let it sit there. And we all ordered ice and\nhe made this big thing about waiting till the bottom melted and then sucking\nit out, saying that’s what he liked to do because when his father used to buy\nhim ices when he was little, that’s what he did.\nGot a cab over to see Dolly Parton at Sandy Gallin’s. Dolly doesn’t want\nanyone to know where she lives because she’s had death threats. So we\nwere there and I guess Dolly was appalled that we brought as many people,\nbut Keith and everybody had wanted to have a totally star-filled day. Sandy\nGallin had the spots measured where he wanted the portraits to go on the\nwalls and everything. And then we walked back to the hotel.\nCalled Cher’s number and it was a recording that said that anyone\ncalling this private number was automatically invited to the barbecue going\non there.\nSo we went over to Cher’s and the door opened and they let us in, but\nwe could see that Cher and her boyfriend were shocked to see us. And Cher\nserved good pork and beans and she wouldn’t say what the secret was, and\nfinally she admitted it was that she opened a can of Campbell’s and poured\nin a lot of hot sauce. The little Allman boy, Elijah, was being a brat and\ngoing around cutting the buds off every flower, any one that was just about\nto open. And Cher was funny, she told a story about this crane that came\nand stayed two days and ate all the fish. And then later on we went to Lisa\nLove’s and she said, “Gee, a crane just landed in my yard and he’s eating all\nthe fish.” So the crane gets around. And she told us that at the wedding\nMadonna had asked her how to cut the cake. Cher said, “As if I know.” And\nthen Madonna was asking people if she should put the cake on plates, and\nshe was just handing it to everyone in her hand. You know, being “earthy.”\nAnd there was a copy of the Star there that had this story about Cher in\nit. And somehow everybody wound up reading it. And Cher was upset\nbecause it said she never bathed. And it said, “Next week: Cher’s meeting\nwith Jackie Kennedy.” And nobody wanted to ask if she’d ever had one or\nnot. And Cher talked about meeting me in an airport in someplace like\nAtlanta in ‘65. On one of our first tours. She was with Sonny.\nDavid Horii, that new Interview illustrator, came to dinner with us at Mr.\nChow’s, and I was telling Fred that David was very good, and Fred was in\none of those moods, he said, “I’d have to see his work. I haven’t seen his\nportfolio.” And I said, “Well Fred, I am telling you, this person is very\ngood” (dinner $530).\nAnd then we went to Brad Branson’s. He was Paul Jasmin’s assistant\nand now he’s a photographer, too. It turned out they had the best time there\nbecause they took Keith and everybody to a porno store where they got a\nspray called “Fart” and they sprayed it in the car and everybody had to\njump out (hotel tips $50)."

And\nhe’s skinnier and dirtier and he had a sore leg and was limping, so that was\nsad—he’s been walking the streets too much. And then I went to Dr.\nBernsohn’s.\nI was in there a long time finding out about the ghost they were\nthrowing out. Judy the secretary wouldn’t come in for three days and then\nshe did and caught Dr. Bernsohn crying because the force was so strong.\nAnd they said he shouldn’t have called the ghost because he’s Jewish, that\nJudy should have done it because she’s Catholic and more easygoing, and\nit’s different than if they were telling you some phony stuff. I mean, why\nwould they make this kind of stuff up? It must be real. So I left there. And\nMatty was still waiting.\nI told Matty he should go to museums and auctions and be learning\nthings. He should get a job at one of these places and stop being on the\noutside and he had a long answer for that—something about being in a\nplane and zeroing in on Madison Avenue and killing the Jews. He was\ntalking about that a lot. The thing is, we have the same life. We go to all the\nsame places. He kept saying how attractive I am. But all I’m attracting is\nhim (magazines and newspapers $4).\nAnd the Campbell Soup Company hated the painting they\ncommissioned. It turns out they wanted exactly what they’d said—a\npainting of their new box. I’d tried to do something clever and make it\nmore, but they hated it and now I have to do it over again.\nAnd the horrible news of the day was that finally after not hearing from\nSandy Gallin about the Dolly Parton portraits, I called, and the secretary got\non and said, “Ohhh, Sandy’s soooo embarrassed,” and saying that it just\ndoesn’t look like my art. Sandy just doesn’t like the pictures, she said. And\nafter fifteen minutes, she popped the question of could he get his $10,000\nback. And I said, “Well, sure, you know but doesn’t he want me to do it\nagain!” She said they’d thought it would be more colorful, more Pop. But I\nmean, I should have known, because it all started out so strange, with Dolly\ncalling and saying that she was the one who wanted to buy it-as a gift for\nSandy-and then that was just so they could get a better price, I guess,\nbecause when I said, “Well, I’d like to give you one, Dolly, for being so\nnice to Sandy to give these to him,” they called back and said, “Well, since\nyou were going to give a free one, why not just knock down the price\ninstead?” You know? Hollywood. Well, I’ve learned things. Next time I’m\ngoing to make them work for it, like come in and see if they like the\npictures and everything every single step of the way-make them work hard.\nOh, and then they even said that I could try to sell it. They said they’d give\n“permission.” So that was horrible."

I brought Dr. Bernsohn for Tama, and she’s\nfunny, like a Jewish mother—she dressed in Chinese clothes because we\nwere going to Mr. Chow’s and she had on crystal earrings so that the crystal\ndoctor would look at them. But now I’m afraid she will write about\nBernsohn and that he’ll get into trouble. Because see, using crystals to heal\nand stuff isn’t really legit.

The guy was trying to\ncall his ex-girlfriend who was getting married, and then after he talked to\nTama, he did get the ex-girlfriend and he told her about what had happened,\nand now she’s coming on the date with Tama and him. This is how\ndesperate people are (cab $5, dinner $350).\nAnd my guy, oh God, I just hated him from the start. The one they\nbrought for me.

I’ve met his mother. And the guy\nfrom the wrong number that Tama’s going to see is in the Egyptian\ndelegation at the U.N., so you can imagine. They originally had a doctor for\nme, but he had to go on duty at the last minute. And my date went off to call\nhis boyfriend. But it is fascinating to meet new people. Then the Ford\nmodel I got for Paige disappeared. But she was disappointed anyway,\nbecause he was an airhead, he could only talk model talk. And we ran into\nHolly Woodlawn who was celebrating her facelift—yes, she had one! She’s\ntelling everyone. With all her problems, she got a facelift! She never did get\na sex change, I don’t think.

Wednesday. The day my biggest nightmare\ncame true.\nThe day started with Benjamin not picking me up (phone $2, magazines\n$2). I didn’t go to the Matsuda fashion show. I’m just going to talk through\nthis quickly because otherwise I can’t face it.\nNobody from the office would go with me to the Rizzoli Bookstore in\nSoho, but Rupert’s old assistant Bernard had stopped by to visit and he said\nhe would. Rupert dropped us off. The store is long and the signing was on\nthe second floor in the balcony.\nI’d been signing America books for an hour or so when this girl in line\nhanded me hers to sign and then she—did what she did. The Diary can\nwrite itself here.\n[She pulled Andy’s wig off and threw it over the balcony to a male who ran\nout of the store with it. Bernard held the female while the store called the\npolice but Andy declined to press charges. The staff at Rizzoli asked him if\nhe’d like to stop, but there were people with books still waiting so he said\nno, that he would finish. The Calvin Klein coat he was wearing had a hood,\nso he pulled it up over his head and kept signing.]\nI don’t know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony. She\nwas so pretty and well-dressed. I guess I called her a bitch or something and\nasked how she could do it. But it’s okay, I don’t care—if a picture gets\npublished, it does. There were so many people with cameras. Maybe it’ll be\nthe cover of Details, I don’t know. If I would’ve hit the girl or something\nthen I would’ve been wrong and there would be lawsuits and everything.\nIt’s getting violent out there again, like the sixties. I usually stand up at\nthose things but there I was sitting down and people were above me and the\nsetup was all wrong and I was so worn out and hating Craig Nelson and I\nwasn’t fast enough and it just happened so fast and Bernard was really\nsweet. But you know, you’re in this place and everybody’s being so nice\nand you don’t think anything will happen. She was really pretty, a nice-\nlooking well-dressed girl. They had her cornered for a while and then they\nlet her go. It was too unusual. I guess these people had gone around telling\neverybody they were going to do it, because a lot of people later said they’d\nheard things. It was so shocking. It hurt. Physically. And it hurt that nobody\nhad warned me.\nAnd I had just gotten another magic crystal which is supposed to protect\nme and keep things like this from happening. So I was too nerve-racked, it\nwas like in a movie. I signed for one and a half hours more I guess,\npretending that it didn’t mean anything, and eventually it doesn’t. You have\nto live with it. It was like getting shot again, it wasn’t real. I was just the\ncomedian there, pleasing the people. And it was so close to Halloween.\nThen Bernard dropped me and I gave him $10.\nAnd I got home and had two English muffins with margarine which isn’t\nso good, and garlic, and two cups of tea and carrot juice and I tried the\nCampbell’s dry soup. It was good. And no accessories in it.\nAnd then PH called to see what time I was leaving for Washington in the\nmorning, but I got off the phone fast, I didn’t tell her what happened\nbecause I couldn’t face it.\nShe found out, though, I guess, because she called back an hour later\nand told me she was proud of me and that I was “a great man.” And\n(laughs) that sure was a first. So that’s that and now I never have to talk\nabout it again."

I hadn’t fallen asleep until 2 A.M.\nand I had to get up so early but somehow I pulled myself out of bed. To\nhave to get right up is so horrible without talking to the Diary for an hour or\nso, just quietly getting used to it. But I did it and the driver Chris had gotten\nwas nice (driver $40).\nAnd we got to LaGuardia and Craig Nelson was standing out there\n(magazines $8) and we got the shuttle to Washington. We were picked up at\nthe airport by a lady who had a small car. She took us to a radio show and\nthis guy was supposed to be the neatest guy in town, and it was the most\nhorrible interview. I was still too upset about the night before and I couldn’t\nthink of anything funny, and he wanted to know about the book and I didn’t\nknow anything and he said, “I guess you didn’t write the book,” and I said,\n“I guess I didn’t.” It was one of his most difficult interviews. He will\nremember it.\nAnd on these trips, God, I hate Craig so much. He’s there saying, “Andy\nand I are both interested in sex.” And I’m saying, “Craig, I’m not interested\nin sex.” I mean, Chris is like a piece of heaven compared to Craig. Although\n(laughs) actually they’re alike. They just think food food food and what\nthey can take home. Although Craig is fatter. And they’re both pigeon-toed.\nBut Christopher is finally paying his dues, coming with me to these things\n—he’s not even taking pictures and getting phone numbers, he’s actually\nworking, taking care of me and organizing me.\nThe lady with the small car drove us to the airport and the plane was\nlate, left at 8:50, and we ran into Susan Mulcahy. She didn’t seem to have\nheard what had happened to me at Rizzoli, she’d been away from work at\nthe Post I guess, maybe she hadn’t gone in that day, so I didn’t know what\nto do. When you’re friends with the person are you supposed to tell them\nand are they then supposed to not write it or what? I didn’t know what you\ndo. So I didn’t say anything and she was self-conscious because I’d caught\nher down there. I guess maybe she was seeing a person that she’s having an\naffair with and she was all feminine and looked so pretty, like she was just\nthrough with a hard day of making out. So she wasn’t thinking about me,\nshe was worried about herself.\nAnd so then Chris and Craig dropped me off, and I knew when I left the\ncab that they were going to dish me, even though they don’t get along.\nCraig’d been telling people what had happened on Wednesday all day. And\nI was exhausted and I ate garlic bread and went to bed at 1:00."

And I looked at the Daily\nNews and there in Liz Smith’s column was the item on what happened to\nme, and it was nice, she did it in a nice way. And there was a news story\nabout the hot dog man on 33rd and Park who got attacked by a roving band\nof kids and his money was stolen and his cart overturned. But the next day\nhe was back on his corner because he had to earn a living, even though he\nhad second- and third-degree burns.\nGot on the plane and went to Detroit. There was a fat girl holding up the\nAmerica book to show she was our driver. About 200 pounds. Sweet. And\nDetroit is all sprawled out. It looks like L.A. And everybody working\neveryplace is black. We went to the top floor of this hotel, the dining room\noverlooking Detroit, and had lunch.\nI had to go to the bathroom and there was a black guy there so friendly,\nit seemed like a sex thing, and I left quickly. And then Craig went to the\nbathroom and didn’t come back for twenty-five minutes.\nAnd then we went to the Detroit Museum and book-signed there. And\nthe guy who gave that Detroit wedding we went to in the sixties came! And\nhe had the advertisement for it and the old Velvet Underground cover\nsigned by all the Velvets, except, I think, Lou. And my signature’s changed\nso much since those days. I’d signed it with a ballpoint pen and … the Mick\nJaggers I signed with pencil and then after that I always signed with the\nfelt-tips.\nThen we went to Bloomington. Sold 400 books and 190 Interviews. Sold\neverything. Had to leave at 7:30 to get the 8:30 plane. I think people get in\nline again and become repeaters. And so on the way to the airport, after a\nwhole day of nothing but signing, the girl who’d been driving the car all\nday suddenly came up with a stack of books that she wanted autographed!

And just as we were arriving at the Olympic\nTower where she’s living now, so was Khashoggi, and she had never met\nhim and neither had I. She’s a friend of his daughter, Nubila’s. And he’s a\nbig guy. He doesn’t look foreign. Really big. He was nice."

I didn’t even call to wish her a Happy\nThanksgiving.\nSo I’m at the office and the phone rings and it’s Geri Miller calling from\nthe women’s shelter and she goes back and forth from “You scumbag!” to\nbeing sweet. And she’s screaming in the background calling some\npoliceman “You nigger!” and I could hear him getting mad and then later\nshe’s screaming at this social worker, “You black lesbian nigger, get away\nfrom me!” And she’s saying that Mario Cuomo is her father—the other day\nshe called and said Muhammad Ali was—and then she knows everything—\nlike she knew the cover I did of Cuomo for Manhattan, inc. magazine. And\nshe’s saying, “He has a birthmark there and I have a birthmark there, so he’s\nmy father!” It’s like talking to Crazy Matty. And they both have all this\nenergy. She said, “When you saw me on the street I was working in real\nestate for Alice Mason.” That’s exactly what she said. And I have a funny\nfeeling she’s a young senile person. After seeing these Donahue shows.\nBecause she says they say it’s schizophrenia, but I don’t think so. A Jewish\ngirl who came from New Jersey—in her Trash days she was our most\nsensible superstar—then in the seventies she suddenly got crazy. One day\nshe was very down to earth, worrying about her topless dancing career, and\nthen the next week she showed up barefoot at 860, saying that the Mafia\ngave her LSD because she knew too much! From working in all those\ntopless bars they own on 45th Street, I guess.\nAnd so she’s calling from shelters and the odd thing is, she remembers\nall these details of things that happened to her way in the past. Like she\nbrought up when she had sex with Eric de Rothschild in the sixties and she\nsaid that after they had sex he called up Jane Holzer to go for a walk in the\npark, and she said, “Why did he have to call up Jane Holzer—why didn’t he\ntake me for a walk?” I mean, every detail. Does that mean nothing’s\nhappened in her life since then?\nOh, and more sixties updates: My sixty-year-old cousin called and she\nwas in town with her son and said they wanted to come and see the office,\nso they came down. And her son is the one who knew Ondine in Pittsburgh.\nHe once took the film courses that Ondine was (laughs) giving there, and he\ntold me that Ondine is now selling hot dogs at Madison Square Garden. I’m\nserious. You know, Ondine “rented” all those films from us and then never\nreturned them. Loves of Ondine, Chelsea Girls. And there was a story about\nGerard Malanga in New York, about him being the new archivist for the\nParks Department and for some reason Vincent was upset that Gerard was\nsaying he was thirty-eight. I took a picture of Gerard the other week,\nthough, and he does look great. But how old is he really? About forty-two\nor forty-three? And oh, God, on my Blue Cross I just scribble and make it\nup all the time and then I get these things that say my birthday is August 28,\n1982, so if I have an accident I probably won’t get (laughs) my money.\nI’m starting to think that crystals don’t work. Because look what’s\nhappened lately when they’re supposed to be protecting me—my rug has\ncancer from the moths, I stepped on a beautiful old plastic ring and crushed\nit, and I was assaulted at the book signing. But I’ve got to believe in\nsomething, so I’ll continue with the crystals. Because things could always\nbe worse."

I thought about the moths in my rug and I puttered around.\nWent to meet Wilfredo, Bernard, and PH at the Matt Dillon play, Boys\nof Winter (cab $4). And the play, I mean, after Apocalypse Now, what can\nyou do? If it’d come out eight years ago it would’ve been a smash hit.\nEverybody got killed, and it was so sad, but the ending was just too corny,\nbecause the guy would never have killed his friend like that. And it’s the\ngayest play on Broadway. One of the reviews should say that and then\nmaybe it would be a hit. Because it’s all men caring about each other.\nIt was raining out and we walked toward Eighth Avenue. Got a\nlimousine that was going by ($20). So we went to the Hard Rock and Matt\nwas already there. He introduced me to his mother, and remember I said the\nlast time I saw him he gave me a pat on the shoulder and a kiss? Well last\nnight he just gave me a pat on the shoulder. Maybe because it was in front\nof his mother. But then I started thinking that when he saw me the last time\nhe was probably rehearsing for this play and he wanted to see how it felt to\nkiss a fairy in public.\nSat with Linda Stein and she talked about trying to sell Stallone a house.\nHe called her from his plane and said, “Linda? Sly. Just one thing before we\ntalk at length later: If Elvis were alive today, would he live in an apartment\nor a house!” And I’m trying to decide if I should try to sell him my house\nfor $5 million. She says she’ll have to see it first. The house next door only\nwent for $1.9, but who knows what she could get?\nBernard went and got lost, talking to Susan Dey at the bar. He’s a\nwould-be starfucker. Susan Dey was emotional about the play and said she\nwas protesting war now. I don’t know which war. Nicaragua, I guess.\nWe left and the rain had turned into a sparkling mist. And we passed a\nguy in a camouflage jacket going toward the Hard Rock and PH yelled,\n“Harry Dean!” because she thought it looked like Harry Dean Stanton and it\nwas, so we talked for a minute. I always thought he was this teenager who\njust looked really bad because he’d taken a lot of drugs, but it turns out he’s\nnot a teenager—he’s almost sixty, so gee, he looks good! Then Bernard and\nWilfredo dropped me and I gave them a twenty because that’s all I had.\nAnd then at work that afternoon I’d spilled some tea on a stack of\nPolaroids of some portrait and then I couldn’t unstick them, they were all\nstuck together. With all those signs I’d put up all over, like “Do Not Carry\nWater Into the Print Room” and I wound up doing it."

Arne Glimcher was\nthere, he’s producing a Robert Redford movie about the art world.\nWe went to the Lewises’ house.

But the horrible thing was seeing everybody looking thirty years\nolder. I’m so spoiled from going around with nineteen-year-olds. At least\nIvan Karp has a lot of energy and he’s fun. Oh, and Ivan says he’s (laughs)\ncollecting Barbarian jewelry now, he gets it at a store in the East 90s. The\ntribe—the original hordes."

But in the\nend ideas are actually just physically working it all out. You’d think it’s\neasy once you have an idea, but it’s not. It’s just like writing. Like the\nTruman Capote play I wanted to do—if I’d only looked at it at all before he\ndied, I would’ve followed him some more for three days and kept my mouth\nshut and really gotten something. So we walked around and people nudged\neach other when they saw us.\nThen went over to Jean Michel’s birthday lunch at Mortimer’s that\nMarsha May from Texas was giving. And finally I gave Jean Michel a gift\nhe really loved—the rhythm and blues six-album set, that Atlantic just put\nout. And Ahmet Ertegun wrote some of the songs, those were his big years.\nJean Michel was reading the liner notes all through lunch.\nAnd then afterwards Jean Michel wanted to go to Bloomingdale’s, it was\n4:30. So we went over there. He wanted to get a $3,000 gift certificate for\nhis mother and when he took out his gold Amex card one guy asked to see\nID but the other guy nudged him and said, “It’s okay.”"

When we got to the office the\nInterview party was in full swing. I never went over to it, but people drifted\nonto our side of the building. It was over right about 4:00.\nAnd I told Gael to come up and pose for pictures because I was going to\ndo a drawing of her because Fred told me that I had to. She looks good now,\nvery thin. Her hair’s beautiful and her skin is strong and she doesn’t wear\nmakeup. Peter, her husband, had come to pick her up and she was wearing a\npale pink leather dress and I said, “Oh, where’d you get that pretty dress?”\nand the first thing she says is, “Well, you know, I never ever take anything\nfor free, but they sold this to me for $10 because nobody wanted it!” She\nwas very defensive right away to tell me that, as if she knew that I was\nhearing about all the stuff she gets for presents from her business admirers\nin L.A., sending her flowers and candy and stuff. I forget that these\nInterview editors actually are powerful. And I told her she should be going\nout to dinner with people constantly like Annie Flanders from Details does,\nand she said, “I’m not a hustler.”\nAnd Greg Gorman the photographer from L.A was at the Interview party\nand told me that Joe Dallesandro’s got a big role in a new TV cop series\nthat’s starting in January. Then went home and Gael and Peter dropped me\noff.\nI ran into the 6’5” son of my neighbor, Dr. Hamilton. He got so tall\nsuddenly this year now that he went off to college. He’s handsome. He’s the\none that used to play ball in the street with the father and the one who said\nhe used to see Yul Brynner run into the building across the street to see\nsome woman and this kid would time how long it took them.\nTook a gang to Nippon for Christmas Eve dinner and I gave out the little\nBe Somebody with a Body paintings (dinner $280).\nAnd then we went down to Kenny Scharf’s loft on Great Jones. In the\nbedroom Kenny had these original Flintstones and Jetson cartoon drawings,\nand he said, “Jon Gould got these for me.” He actually said that to me. That\nwas so odd to hear. He said Jon got them at an auction. I mean, you know\nsomebody, they’re living in your house, and then suddenly they don’t know\nyou anymore but they still see all your friends.

And I mean, she doesn’t have many other friends. But New Year’s was\neasy and unemotional. Nobody was mushy.\nDuring the day, Jay was moping around the office but he’s been better\nsince I had the talk with him about all his negativity probably causing the\ncold sores on his mouth.\nBought the papers and saw that the eyeglass place had given an item to\nthe newspapers that I buy my glasses there and that they’re bulletproof like\nthe president of Nicaragua’s (newspapers $5, cabs $3, $2). I mean, I’m not\ngoing to go there anymore. Why would they make that up? I mean, what are\nbulletproof eyeglasses? What could they do for you?\nI was going to call lots of people and wish them Happy New Year but\nthen I couldn’t get it together to call anybody.\nSam picked up PH and they came to pick me up (cab $10). So we got to\nJane Holzer’s and of course she wasn’t ready, after telling me she wanted to\nget to Roy Cohn’s party at 9:00 so she could really work the room for her\nreal estate. She was still in her bathrobe. So then she got into her makeup\nand a black Armani jacket and pants. She’s a little heavier.\nAnd so we went to Roy Cohn’s townhouse, and it was sad to see him\nlike that, it really was. He didn’t look old but God, he looked so sick. I\ndon’t know what to describe it as. And it was people like Joey and Cindy\nAdams.\nSteve Dunleavy the Australian journalist said, “Give me a bon mot for\nthe new year,” and I couldn’t think of one. Roy’s ninety-year-old aunt was\nthere, she owns Van Heusen shirts, she was the one who gave permission\nfor me to use Ronald Reagan’s old Van Heusen ad in my painting. She was\nlike a WASP dowager, only with a hook nose, and she still has every one of\nher marbles. Jane went over to her and said, “I’m sure you don’t remember\nme,” and she said, “Oh yes I do, Jane, and how is your wonderful son Rusty\nand his horseback riding?”\nAnd Doris Lilly was there. And Roy’s nephew or something from Palm\nBeach who writes for the Miami Herald and wants to write for Interview.\nMonique Van Vooren was there, she walked into the front room shielding\nher face, she said, “Oh my, it’s the same wonderful lighting as always.”\nBecause it was horrible and bright and with this old crowd it was really a\nhorror show.\nAnd then Regine was there and she invited us to the $2,000-a-plate Julio\nIglesias dinner-concert right afterwards at the Essex House, so we got\nourselves excited for that.\nOh, and I got a Christmas card from Jann Wenner and his wife and a\nbaby. Did they have a baby or did they adopt one? The name was “Wenner.”\nI don’t remember her being pregnant.\nAt Essex House the best thing was a girl came over and gave us all brass\nkey chains that were engraved concert tickets that said: “Julio Iglesias,\nEssex House, December 31, 1985, $2,000.” And Angie Dickinson was\nthere, who’s always so nice. Sam went over and took her picture and told\nher he worked for me and she said, “Oh, I love him.” Regis Philbin did a\ncomedy introduction about people calling him Phoebus Region and Rebus\nPhilbin and things like that and then he introduced the celebs and the\nspotlight went on me, and I froze. And then at midnight they shot big\nspangles out of the cannons. And there were orchids and it was fun, and\nJulio’s great line was he comes out on stage and says, “I FEEL GUILTY! I\nLOVE YOU!” And he kept talking about how we were all one family. And\neverybody who heard the price of this thing said that it must be a benefit,\nbut it wasn’t, it was just for Julio.\nLeft there and went over to the Hard Rock Café and the rock and roll\ncrowd there was the most corny crowd in the world. It always is. Some\nCNN people interviewed me on what I was going to be doing next year and\nI said I was working on a Barbie doll. And then somebody who came in told\nus that Ricky Nelson had just been killed in a plane crash in Texas."

And she’s so\nexcited that she’s going to Hollywood to play a woman Dracula. I mean\nhow many more women Draculas can they have? She’s so excited. She said\nthey gave her “artistic control.” She was saying that she was going to turn\nyellow and then white and then green, and so then I thought that maybe\nthey just gave her artistic control of her face."

So\nJulian took us into the kitchen and we sat around there eating couscous. It\nwas so good. He gave me a copy of his book to read to see what I thought.\nAnd what I thought was that he was really influenced by Popism. It starts\noff with how he arrived from Waco, Texas, and then being at Max’s and\nwho he met. Everybody but me. It was sort of interesting because he’d go\nback and forth from then to later, like he’d say, “August, 1983” and put\nsomething in. I don’t know if it’s a prologue to a book or if it’s a catalogue\nor what. It’ll sell a lot.\nThen they brought out the birthday cake. And I was shooting with my\ncamera and this person pulls down her hat and walks away and I didn’t even\nknow who it was and I went into the kitchen and then Diane Keaton comes\nin and said, “Hi kids, how are you?” And I mean, who does she think she\nis? I was taking pictures of the cake. And I mean, she goes around the city\ndoing her photographs of anybody she wants, so where does she have the\nnerve to act like that? And then she went downstairs and I was talking in a\nloud voice about how I thought she was a phony and maybe she heard, but I\ndon’t care. If I see her again I’m going to tell her off once and for all, what\na big phony-baloney she is. Julian had a lot of new work around. He’s\nbuying back his early work that he sold for $600 or something, for about\n$40,000, because he knows he should. He doesn’t know how to deal with\nme and Jean Michel. He owes us some pictures (supplies $1).\nHe had a lot of Joseph Beuys stuff around. Joseph Beuys just died on\nFriday. And Tinkerbelle died. It was in the Friday papers. It said that she\ndied on Tuesday when she jumped out of a window.\nEdit deAk was wearing one of these Afghan hats and she said that she\ntold Diane Keaton once to “stop wearing those stupid hats,” and then she\ncomes in wearing a stupid hat herself and runs into Diane Keaton, so she\nwas really embarrassed.\nAnd the Music issue is coming up and I really have to call Eric\nAndersen back, he’s been calling me, and get him into the issue. Interview\ndoesn’t ask me to do interviews myself anymore or anything. They used to\nask me to do a person now and then. Were my interviews bad, or …"

And\nthere were a lot of other things to do but I decided to do that. I asked if I\ncould bring someone to Yoko’s and later they called and said okay, so I\nasked Sam Bolton.

Jezebel redid it and it looks cleaner now. She kissed me hard on my\ncheek. I was next to Roberta Flack and one of the Spinks brothers came in\nwearing a big fur coat. And Michael Douglas came later.\nAnd I guess I don’t know how to talk to little Sean Lennon. I’m too\nabstract. Because Roberta Flack was so great with him. He said, “Roberta,\nwhat is a torch singer?” And she said, “Well, Sean, a torch singer is\nsomeone who sings with not too much music playing, very softly, and with\na lot of feeling.” And then he felt he understood. The sweet potato pie was\nreally good and then I realized it must have had bacon lard in the crust.\nAfterwards Jann Wenner offered me a ride home and so Sam and I went\nwith him and I said he didn’t have to drive Sam downtown, that he’d get out\non 66th Street with me and just get a cab home, and Jann made comments\nlike he didn’t care what I did in my private life.

The drag queen looked like Rupert’s mother with the blonde\nbeehive. She had on pants but a four-inch leather belt really tightening in\nher waist. And a guy came over and said Rupert was an alien and Rupert\nsaid, “I am not an alien. I am Rupert Jason Smith” (lunch $60). And then\nRupert said I had to leave the drag queen a big tip since she stayed open for\nus (tip $25). Gave me goosebumps. Then we went to places run by gay sons\nand fat mothers. Antiques places. Then we went back to the house and the\ngirl had made a dessert, and we ate lots of bread. Then at 7:30 we left for\nNew York and then after John dropped me off I remembered that I’d been\ninvited to Chastity Bono’s birthday party.\nSo I cabbed downtown to Sixth Avenue between 9th and 10th, a\nMexican restaurant ($6). The party was in full swing. Every girl was like a\nmovie star, I mean, she’d copied a look. Some looked like Molly Ringwald,\nthere were three or four Madonnas. Cher didn’t come to the party because\nshe and Chastity had a fight. Chastity goes to the School of Performing\nArts. Stayed till 12:30 (cab $7)."

I was\nplanning to have a surprise birthday party for Sam, but then Paige had\nalready organized one, but Paige wasn’t talking to me. I called her at\nInterview and she said, “I’m working, I can’t talk.” I said, “Paige, it’s me.”\nAnd she said, “Yes, well, I’m very busy.” And so she was mad at me, but I\nknew she was mad at me before we went to Europe because she gave me\nthe camera, and now Paige without a camera just isn’t herself, there’s no\nmore darting around and being hysterical. And this went on all afternoon,\nand then Jean Michel called and came over and Paige came in while we\nwere sitting together, and that was tense, and then she said that she would\nset up the dinner for Sam’s birthday at Odeon but that she wouldn’t be\ngoing to it, and she left work early. And then somebody at the office talked\nto Paige and told me what was wrong and we straightened everything out—\nshe was mad that I didn’t call all the time I was over in Europe, since she\nalways calls me when she’s on vacation, and also because she said I led her\non right up until the last minute, letting her think I would make it okay with\nFred that she could go on the Paris trip and then instead we took Chris. Fred\njust didn’t want the extra work—it’s so easy to dump Chris at a hotel and\nwith Paige it would’ve meant finding her a nice hotel and then picking her\nup and having dinner and seeing advertisers, and all that. And Fred was so\ngrouchy on this trip and I told him he was and he said, “I’m old enough to\nbe rotten if I want.”\nAnd so at the office I talked to the girl from the Schwarzenegger\nwedding and they won’t let me bring somebody so I told them I just\ncouldn’t go alone, and so she started giving me my choice of people to go\nwith and she said, “You can go with Grace Jones.” I said, “Grace is not\nreliable. And if she did go she’d bring her own people, anyway.” And then\nthey said, “Well Abe Schmuck is coming, you can go with him,” and I said,\n“I don’t know Abe Schmuck.” And then they said, “Joanne Schmuck is\ngoing,” and I said, “I don’t know Joanne Schmuck.” And then they said,\n“Lady Schmuck is going, you can go with her,” and I said, “I do not know\nLady Schmuck.” And I mean who are these nobodies? I said, “I guess I\ncan’t go.” So I guess I’m not going. And Fred said not to try to get him\ninvited, since he hadn’t been invited on his own. And Maura Moynihan\ncalled and said she hadn’t been invited to the thing but that she was going\nup anyway, to Boston, because Kerry Kennedy and Mary Richardson were\ngoing to be there.\nSo anyway, Paige and I sort of made up and so it was over, it was\ninteresting. It’s weird that Paige would get so emotional about me. And then\nI had to be creative to think of birthday presents for Sam during the fight\nwith Paige. I stuck money in that grandmother-type birthday card, and I did\na canvas that had dollars pasted onto it and then I remembered they even\nmake those sheets of money, but this you can just rip money off when you\nneed it, like for tips. Went home and Geraldo Rivera was starting to open Al\nCapone’s secret rooms on live TV in Chicago, but it was going to go on for\ntwo hours.\nSam picked me up (cab $10) and we went to the Odeon. And Paige had\nsome advertisers there to do some business, and I told her to invite Keith\nand his new Juan, and then Billy Boy had just arrived in town from Dallas\nand Paige invited him, so it was actually fun and not strained. And Keith\ngave Sam a radio from the Pop Shop which he just opened, and Paige gave\nhim a book on the White House and Wilfredo gave him boxer shorts from\nArmani."

      "text": "Massachusetts—New York\nI got up at 6:00, called Peter at 7:00. The doorbell rang half an hour early\nand it was Peter with no Grace. He said he went to pick her up and woke\nher up and she said to come back in an hour. The weather was just a little\noff. Slightly cloudy.\nWe went to pick up Grace in the Village and she came out in Norma\nKamali black wool underwear. Also a fur Kenzo hat. She put her makeup on\nin the car and in the plane. We arrived an hour late to the airport. The flight\nwas so easy, through this grey fog all the way and nothing happened,\nwhereas on a clear day sometimes you hit an air pocket and go diving.\nGrace put on a green Azzedine in the ladies’ room of the airport. Peter\nrented a car, a yellow station wagon, and he knew where the church was\nand drove us there. Then he went to check on his house in East Falmouth.\nThe crowd outside the church screamed, “Grace!” and “Andy!” There\nwas the biggest mob I’ve ever seen around a church. We went in and they\nhad folding chairs near the door. Oprah Winfrey gave a speech. Jamie and\nPhyllis Wyeth were in front of us and they turned around and said that we’d\ncaused too much commotion outside, they were funny. And at the car rental\nwe’d seen all these glamorous names like “Clint Eastwood” and “Barbara\nWalters” and the St. James girl, but they weren’t there. And watching this\nstorybook wedding, you just wonder about what it’ll be like when the\ndivorce comes.\nJackie got communion so she walked all the way around the church with\nJohn-John to show herself off, she looked beautiful. The church service was\nan hour, and the wedding ceremony was fifteen minutes. They had a girl\nsinging “Ave Maria.” Peter was waiting outside and later he told us that\nwhen Arnold and Maria went out they were nice for the photographers, they\nrolled down the window and smiled and posed. But Jackie never smiled at\nanyone, she was a sourpuss. And I guess they’d had parties for three days or\nsomething, because everyone told me that at a thing the night before,\nArnold gave my portrait of Maria to the Shrivers and said, “I’m gaining a\nwife and you’re gaining a painting.” And everyone was telling me how\ngreat it was, they really loved it. And then a friend of Arnold’s brought in a\nsculpture that Kurt Waldheim sent them and it was really ugly. And\nArnold’s always giving all these speeches, and he said, “My friends don’t\nwant me to mention Kurt’s name because of all the recent Nazi stuff and the\nU.N. controversy, but I love him and Maria does too and so thank you,\nKurt.”\nOutside the church there was a limo and a guy shoves us in and we\ncouldn’t see Peter. Then we got to the compound and Peter had seen us get\nin the limo and followed us so he was right there. He handed me the\ndrawings I did of Maria, but then I didn’t know what to do with them. But\nEddie Schlossberg saw me and he said he’d put them in the house and I\nthanked him.\nIt was freezing. Ran into an Austrian and he took us to a tent where\noyster openers were getting oysters ready and Grace wanted some right then\nand there but they said they were being served to people in the other tent,\nbut then someone came over with a plate of them just for her and she ate\nthirty oysters and then twenty more, just slurping them down.\nAnd Christopher Kennedy was around, he’s so cute. Jackie was sitting\nwith Bettina. And Marc Bohan. I didn’t look at Jackie, I felt too funny. Then\nthere was dancing and music. Peter Duchin and his wife. He was (laughs)\ngoing off to do another party. He works so hard. Grace began dancing and it\nwas like in a movie, everybody stopped to watch. She was dancing with a\nlittle boy. We were at Joe Kennedy’s table with his wife. Talked to Nancy\nCollins. I asked her if she was covering it and she said, “Oh no no no. This\nis a personal thing.” She was best friends with Maria, I don’t know when.\nWe talked about the Stallone piece she did for Rolling Stone, which wasn’t\nmuch, and she was annoyed with Stallone, she said he put her off six times\nand then didn’t give her much time. But he only gave PH an hour and\nInterview’s was really great, unusual. I was trying to take pictures but I\ncouldn’t get in there and really shove. Arnold’s body-building friends had\ncameras and so the Kennedys couldn’t really stop them, but they had their\nown photographer and they would say, “Oh, Chuck, would you come and\ntake this picture?” And so then the pictures all belonged to the Kennedys.\nLike at Madonna’s wedding, they should have let guests take pictures\nbecause people at a wedding, they’d just be doing it for themselves anyway.\nMaybe years later you’d use them but you wouldn’t rush them to the New\nYork Post in the morning.\nThe food was so good, raw vegetables that they steamed while you\nwatched. Grace and Ted Kennedy danced. Then Grace and Arnold were\nhaving a talk about what she should do about Dolph because he’s fucking\nall her girlfriends. I told her she should marry Dolph just for a minute,\nbecause it’d be such a great wedding. But I always give Grace the wrong\nadvice. I’m the one who told her she’d never make it unless she toned down\nher look, that people would never go for anything so extreme.\nThe cake was six or ten feet high. Everybody was coming up and telling\nme how they loved the painting. Shriver gave a speech, he was in tails. And\nhe was talking about “losing a daughter.” Well, I mean, she’s twenty-nine—\nhe’s lucky to lose her.\nAnd Arnold gave a speech and was saying wonderful love things like\nthat he’d make her happy. It was the first time I’ve seen really announceable\nlove, saying everything all out loud.\nThen it was time to leave and two Kennedy boys had Grace by the door\nand one was rubbing his cock against her and then we went to the airport."

The party was fun, except that a cute actor named Tim stole my date,\nSam (laughs), because when Tim said he was staying, Sam said, “I think I\nwill, too.” I wasn’t upset, though, I was glad because then that means I\ndon’t have to feel guilty about going places with Wilfredo. Really I\nwas.relieved because I don’t want to get involved. It’s so nice not to get\nbothered by anybody. Somebody asked me if Sam is homosexual or just\nimmature. I don’t know. He likes older women, but maybe he wants to be\nmothered. Who knows? I wish I were twenty and could go through all this\nagain but I never want to go through anything or anybody again in my\nwhole life. Sam and I just kid around. But he cleans up well and he learns\nthings fast. But when somebody corrects him he gets an attitude sometimes\nand that’s hard to change."

She’s now Lady\nNeidpath. She took us around and gave us a tour. She dropped a whole bowl\nof spaghetti at lunch and just picked it up and put it back in another bowl\nwith the glass in it and everything, and then served it to the people who\ncame later like Kenny Lane. They barbecued beef but it started raining.\nThey dropped a bowl of raspberries and picked them up, too. Pretty table\nsetting and grand.

They had\na big fight because when we ran into Gloria Thurn und Taxis and her\nhusband at Heaven, Billy was so sweet to them but after they left he said, “I\nhate those fascists,” and Chris got mad at him. I guess Billy Boy felt he\nshould’ve been invited to their party or something.\nTried to make phone calls but my hands could hardly move. Fred said\nthat all the chic people were in Europe, that they’d skipped the Statue of\nLiberty thing. Like Jerry Zipkin and Ahmet. How would that happen? Do\nthey call up Nancy Reagan and ask her, “Will the Statue thing be any\ngood?” and she says, “No\"?"

He\nsaid how could I be going to these people when I’m supposed to be smart.\nSo we went to Bernsohn’s and there was a visiting doctor there, American,\nbut he lives in Japan.

Ric has a girlfriend, Paulina, who’s a big model\nand Czechoslovakian and her mother was with them, and she looks even\nyounger than the daughter. And I guess maybe I’m not really Czech,\nbecause I didn’t understand it when they were talking.\nAnd we went to the Garden and I didn’t know this could be done but the\nlimo drove right into the Garden. You drive right (laughs) onto the stage.\nYes, you really do. Ric and Dylan have the same manager. And he kept\nsaying to me, “You have total freedom, total freedom. Go anywhere, take\npictures anywhere—in the bathrooms, on the stage, anyplace.” And they\ntook us into the room and Dylan was there and Tom Petty and Ron Wood.\nAnd Tom Petty’s daughter was around, or maybe it was his wife. She\nlooked just like him.\nAnd Dylan looks good, he had silver-tipped cowboy boots on and he\nwas drinking Jim Beam. And even though they’d told me I had “total\nfreedom,” I’m glad I asked before I took a picture of the three of them\nthere, because Dylan said no. And then later Ric found out that Dylan was\nin a bad mood because he had just had a big fight with his girlfriend who’s\nforty or fifty who I think works for the record company and at the end of\nthe fight she’d said something to him like, “Oh go out and play your ‘Mr.\nTambourine Man’ or whatever.” And that would kill your mood—when\nyour lover calls all your work you’ve done in your life (laughs) “whatever.”\nSo I guess he was left without an ego with a show to do.\nAnd the Pressman kid who owns Barneys was there, he’d been at the\nMTV party the night before, he goes to all these music things, I don’t know\nwhy. I lied and told him that I’d seen the Statue of Liberty windows at\nBarneys.\nI didn’t get any good pictures, really, so I just took four rolls of\natmosphere. And Ron Delsener was running, he went crazy at the end\nbecause if you go past 11:00 then it costs $1,000 extra a minute for the\nunions.\nAfterwards, at that new restaurant on 81st and Columbus, Metropolis,\nDylan came in with his whole family—all his kids and his mother, who was\nnice-looking with white hair. She didn’t look Jewish, but everybody else\ndid. I asked Dylan’s manager if Dylan was Christian now or Jewish again,\nand he said Dylan’s Orthodox and that’s why he wasn’t doing a show the\nnext night—that he didn’t work Friday nights unless the money was really\ngood.\nKeith Richards was supposed to come to the concert, but Patti Hansen\nwas having their baby. Oh, also, the road manager liked Ric Ocasek’s\ngirlfriend Paulina’s mother and so she was giving him her address. He was\nIndian. Paulina said, “We’ve got to get my mother laid before she has to\nleave New York.”"

And we walked down Fifth Avenue, and it started to\nrain and everybody was first recognizing Ric- he’s 6’4”—and then me, so\ntheir minds were blown, and we did autographs and this is when I realized\nthat my camera was gone.

It’s twenty-four tracks.\nHe played the album and you could hear every little thing, and you\nreally hear what lots of studio time and work can do for a record although I\ndon’t know what it all means—you’re not making it a better song, just more\ncommercial, I guess, or … But every little thing is so clear. Ric said he’s\nbeen renting the basement there for two years and you know how much it\ncosts to rent studio time! He said he’s spent millions.

The party began when Dianne Brill arrived with her tits and a big\nbetter-looking version of her ex, Rudolf, and the Savitt girl had a not-as-\nattractive version of Rudolf with her. It was the crème de la party scene.\nPatrick McMullan and I talked, he said he’s really getting into girls now.\nThey put me with Tama at her publisher’s table, Crown.

I mean, do you know the last person in\nthe phone book? Do you know the first person?” So then we started looking\nand he called information and asked them for the number of AAAAAAAA\nBar and they would say, “The AAAAAAAA Bar? Yes, sir.” And then we\ncalled and asked for Richard M. Nixon’s number and they said, “Wait a\nminute,” and then there was a click like they were tracing us and Sean got\nscared and hung up, and then I scared him by telling him that it wasn’t\nreally hung up, even when you hang it up. And then Sam— Yoko’s Sam—\ncalled the White House and a recording said if you wanted to talk to\nPresident Reagan to call back between 1:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon.

But at the end he whispered, “Let’s be the first off the boat.” And\nsure enough, there was no car for us. They do absolutely everything to get\nyou there and absolutely nothing to get you home. So we paid a limo ($25)\nto take us and Fred dropped me."

      "text": "Stuart called and said that he was interested in a platinum flute at Christie’s\nthat was going at auction, and he was trying to get me interested in the gold\none. I met him and Sam there and looked at it and it would’ve made a good\nnecklace. Stuart decided he wouldn’t go above $120,000 for the platinum\none. The silver one went for $4,400, and then I started bidding on the gold\none but my last bid was $22,000 and it went for $40,000. The platinum flute\nwas estimated at $40,000 but the bidding kept going up and up. Stuart kept\nhis paddle up and I could feel his whole body next to me shaking as if he\nwas having an orgasm. He was in a panic to see who the other person was\nwho was bidding, but we looked around and couldn’t figure out where the\nother bids were coming from but when the bidding was over it was Stuart’s\nflute for $170,000, which with the tax and commission is about $200,000.\nStuart was in shock. Just in shock.\nEverybody there thought it was me who’d bought it, not Stuart. People\nran over and started giving me their cards and handing me copies of Flutist\nmagazine. It was really funny. Then reporters came and asked why I wanted\nit, and to some of them I said because it had the World’s Fair emblem on it\nso I needed it for my collection of World’s Fair plastic knives and forks, and\nto some others I said I was buying it to melt down. Stuart couldn’t even\nopen his mouth to tell them it was his flute, he was still shaking, so I\ndragged him out of there. The other guy bidding turned out to be from New\nHampshire and he looked rich. I told Stuart to invite him to one of his\nmusical soirées and try to sell him something. The flute had a whole story,\nsome man willed it to his mistress but then after he died his family couldn’t\nbelieve he’d have a mistress so they held it up for ten years. It’s American.\nBoston. Kincaid.\nThen Stuart wanted two double martinis and four hot chocolates, so we\nwent and got them.\nThen we went to the Antiques Center to see if we could find another\nflute for $2. Stuart’s trying to think of how to pay for this. Then he went\nhome and I cabbed ($6) downtown. I’d made plans to see Sid and Nancy\nwith Stephen Sprouse. It was at the 57th Street Playhouse (tickets $18,\npopcorn $5). Ann Lambton played herself, the movie was sick, real—\nnobody would ever want to be a punk after they saw it."

If you went early in the morning you never got\nanything, so I’d wait till 12;00, lunchtime, because by then they had\nstopped getting calls and they were tired and you had a better chance.\nPeople really do stop calling offices at lunchtime because they assume the\npeople will be out.\nSo we went to the Missoni thing and then went to Le Cirque. Gael was\nthere having dinner with Steven’s friend, Mr. Mulane, the Bally Casino guy.\nHe’s really nice, he knows everybody.\nIt was pouring rain. Got home and turned on TV and saw that John Tesh,\nour old friend who used to be on the news here, is the new main guy on\nEntertainment Tonight with Mary Hart."

And when I got home he called and said he’d just gotten home by\nhimself, that he’d been in the waiting room until noon, and he was kind of\nhigh. He said he thought he’d “joked with” the doctor while he was under\nanesthesia, and oh God, I can just imagine what he said. Fred really could\nbe bad under those circumstances. And I complained a lot to Fred about my\npersonal life which I shouldn’t do. I should just always say everything’s\ncool. He told me that I shouldn’t get involved with these kids’ personal\nlives, like Sam’s and Len’s, because it’s none of my business. And he’s\nright. I was going to scream at Len for not telling me the truth about Sam\nspending the night a few weeks ago at Jill’s boyfriend’s apartment—but\nthen it’s none of my business. And then I guess Sam got involved with\nVictor the other night because Victor called and said, “I have someone you\nknow very well here …” and I couldn’t imagine, and he said, “The blond\nboy who works for you … Sam.” And that stunned me."

And they told me there that I’d just done\nvery well. The Soup number two went pretty high at $6,600. I forgot we’d\nsent Jay to bid on Ladies and Gentlemen, a set of those, and some Flowers.\nJasper’s Numbers set went for $140,000.\nThere was a dinner at 7:30 at River House and Paige said she’d pick me\nup. She arrived and had a basket on her head with flowers on it. It was left\nover from the photo session for Tama’s book, A Cannibal in Manhattan,\nthat they’d done that afternoon at Tavern on the Green. Paige is art-\ndirecting the book, setting up the photos in it. Stuart had told me how\nbeautiful the “hat” looked, but it was just—ridiculous. She’d had on a silver\noutfit, but for the dinner she changed into a black Gaultier but kept the hat\non. The dinner was for Francesco Clemente, it was given by the Angela\nWestwater lady who has the Sperone Westwater Gallery, and the first person\nwhose hand I shake turns out to be Alan Wanzenberg—I didn’t recognize\nhim right away. And then I realized Jed was right across from me. Then Edit\ndeAk came over and told Paige and me, “Oh, the two of you should be\nmarried.” A Tama-type line. I made a faux pas, I said to Alba Clemente, “Is\nBianca coming?” I forgot that Bianca had had an affair with Clemente. She\nsaid, “No. She’s not a friend of mine.” And Thomas Ammann said Mary\nBoone wants to represent me and that I should think about it. Keith and his\nfriend Juan were there. And then about thirty-five people were going down\nto Nell’s. I didn’t want to go and Paige did so I told her to go ahead but she\ninsisted on dropping me off—I can just feel all the weird problems starting\nagain.\nWhen we got to my house, Paige’s flowers had fallen out so she was\ngoing home with an empty basket on her head."

I don’t know if he’s on drugs or if now he’s just always paranoid.\nSo we went to the Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue and\n90th, and the good-looking priest had moved to St. Thomas’s, that big chic\nchurch. And it looked overstaffed—like they had one volunteer for every\neater. Everybody had their own waiter. So we went upstairs and there was\nthis big dykey Irish woman giving the helpers their assignments and she\nsaid, “Are you here for food?” And Victor got offended and that started him\noff insulting people in the line, saying, “Just eat fast and fuck off and get\nout so we can clean up.” This is in a church! And finally I told him, “Victor,\nwe’re here because we want to be.” And there were a lot of photographers, I\ndon’t know if they were from the newspapers or what. So this dykey lady\nsays to me, “I’m putting you on security, to keep people in order.” And I\nsaid, “I can’t do a thing like that.” And she said, “Well that’s what you’re\ngoing to do.” And I said, “No, I’m not.” So I ignored her and we served the\nfood, and it’s such a great church, there was food for people to take home,\ntoo, and I was giving everybody a lot. If there’s this many hungry people\nthere’s really something wrong. A lot of people looked like they just came\nfor a meal so they wouldn’t be lonely, though. Maybe they even lived on\nPark Avenue, you can’t tell.\nAnd at the end it was sick, the councilmen came in and waved their arms\naround to show they cared, in case there were people taking pictures.\nWe left there and Victor dropped me and said he hated Stephen and\nPaige and Tama, that they were phonies and balonies, and then later he\ncalled and was saying he knew I was taping him on the phone and so he was\ntalking “to the people on the other side of the tape recorder,” and I don’t\nknow if he’s on drugs or if he’s just hallucinating on his own. There’s\nsomething wrong with him.\nI saw our Cars video, “Hello Again,” on MTV. They ran it again, and it\nstill looks really good. I can’t believe it came out of our place. And I can’t\nbelieve nobody else had us to do their videos after that. Oh, and I bought\nsome magazines. A lot of them ($25). I walked the dogs and Paige called\nbut I was too cozy to go out to dinner. And then Jean Michel called and he’s\nfurious at Paige because he finally found out about his father playing the\ncannibal in Paige’s pictorial spread for Tama’s book, A Cannibal in\nManhattan, he’d just seen the item on Page Six about it. He said, “What is\nshe trying to do? Is she after my father?” And he said his father’s writing a\nbook, and he said (laughs), “He’s not even a drug addict—how can he write\na book? About what?” That’s the first time I ever heard Jean Michel say\nsomething funny. I wonder if that’s his sense of humor. And he didn’t go to\nGermany for his big show."

And\nStuart’s standing there with so much tension, he said to her, “Can I give you\na ride?” and she said, “No thanks, darling, I have my own car.”\nMonday, December 8,1986\nCab to the West Side to Dr. Li ($4) and did my business there.\nThen Paige was having a ballet lunch at the office (cab $5, newspapers\n$2). Anne Bass was coming with Peter Martins and Heather Watts and Ulrik\nTrojaborg and Bruce Padgett. And they want me to design a curtain and a\nposter and I should’ve told them to talk to Fred. I won’t be able to do\nanything with that little gold Noguchi lion medallion that Peter Martins\nbrought to show me—if that’s what they want, they should just have\nNoguchi do something. But if they want me to do something it should be\nmore American.\nOh, and Jock said that after the AIDS thing Sunday night, the reason\nthey didn’t go to Indochine was because Mercedes Kellogg and Sid Bass go\nthere so Anne Bass didn’t want to run into them, so they went to Nell’s.\nFred came in with Mary Boone in her fur coat and she wants me to go\nwith her gallery, I didn’t talk to Fred yet about what they talked about at the\nlunch.

He had the breath he gets when he drinks, so I guess\nhe’s drinking again.

And the paintings used to\nlook like sensual vaginas, but now they look like they’re having trouble.\nThey’re holes with blood around them and they’ve got names like “Death\nof a Baby.” It’s like Liza’s life.\nAnd Steve Aronson was there and he was fun, carrying on about how he\ndidn’t get his Christmas bottle of champagne from Interview in 1977. And\nEthel Scull was there and I said she should start living it up and she said she\nwas going to, soon.

It was\nodd, and then Calvin said wouldn’t it be fun to go to Halston’s, a gas, and\nso we all got into cars and we went over there and Dick Cavett came, he\nwas at the party with Bianca.

Paige was meeting me there\nbefore we went down to Dennis Hopper’s show at Tony Shafrazi’s gallery.\nAnd Dennis’s show, the photographs were nothing special, I guess Tony\njust wanted publicity with a movie star. Met Keith and Kenny there, they\nwere fun. Paige was peeved when she took a picture of Keith and then he\nsaid (laughs), “Oh Andy, why don’t you sign this for me?” Matt Dillon was\nthere with a blonde girl who looked like a young Diane Lane. Diane Lane’s\nonly like twenty, but this girl was even younger. Everybody kept telling\nDennis how great he was in Blue Velvet. I tried to get him to be on our TV\nshow but he was leaving town the next day."

John Powers called, he’s back from Japan, he said he had a new\nmagic watch that has a crystal instead of a battery, but he sounds older all\nthe time so I don’t know if these crystals work. It’s funny about voices,\nDiana Vreeland still has a young voice. Strong.\nKeith was putting down Schnabel, saying that he sat himself right down\nnext to Dennis Hopper at Tony Shafrazi’s dinner for Dennis over the\nweekend and then made the speech about Dennis although he didn’t even\nknow him.\nOh, and Dennis told me the other night that they cut the scene out of\nBlue Velvet where he rapes Dean Stockwell or Dean Stockwell rapes him\nand there’s lipstick on somebody’s ass.\nThen went up to the Metropolitan Museum for the Shiseido party. I\nguess maybe they funded the Vreeland costume show and so then they got\nto give a party there. They had two big Flower paintings of mine. Peach\nwith black outlines. One was a gift from Peter Brant and one was a gift\nfrom Irving Blum who I didn’t even know had one. The museum should get\nall of them—I mean, that’s how they’re supposed to be—all together.\nThen from the museum Steven Greenberg gave us a ride down to the\nfirst party at the Tunnel on Twelfth Avenue and 28th Street, the club that’s\nbuilt in the tunnel of some abandoned railroad tracks. I’m the one that told\nthe Bonjour jeans guy to just keep the name the “Tunnel.” And it was fun\nthere, good music and Glorious Food. Serge the Glorious headwaiter came\nover and said hi. Haoui was the doorman, Rudolf was there, it’s a great\nbuilding.\nIan Schrager was there but he walked out of one of my pictures. I guess\nhe didn’t want to be photographed at somebody else’s club. He was in this\nbeautiful blue suit and tie, and he’s gained some weight, so he’s got that\nhefty, stocky, prosperous look. Handsome. Like James Caan. Steve Rubell\nwas in a business suit the other night saying, “I’m still in my business\nclothes, I just closed a deal.”\nTalked to Stuart. He said that this one guy was giving so much of his\ntime to do charity work for Stuart’s school, but I told him, “Look, there’s a\nreason a person will give up so much time, it’s not for nothing—either he’s\ndown there using your phones or he’s getting away from his wife or he’s\nusing your limousine or he’s drinking up your liquor—it’s always\nsomething, it’s never for nothing.”"

And he gets on the phone and says, “Dahling! Come right\ndown!” and it’ll be Al Pacino who’s tearing himself away from Diane\nKeaton to come down and see him. Or it’ll be Dustin Hoffman.\nAnd the secretaries say things to him like, “You can either see your\neditor at Random House at 2:44 and get out by 3:32 or at 3:46 and get out\nby 4:34,” and Julian says, “I will take the 2:44.”\nAnd he’s painting over beautiful Japanese backgrounds and ruining\nthem. And he’s got tarpaulins with words glued on them and he says,\n“These are from my San Salvadorean exposition.”\nIt was the most pretentious afternoon I’ve ever had. And I left there\ncompletely convinced I should buy a Schnabel. Fred thinks so, too. I told\nJulian I’d give him a ride uptown and we went outside and there’s a\nlimousine parked and he’s striding toward it and I said, “Uh, Julian, that’s\nnot my car,” and I pointed to Tony in the little Japanese one.

I\ndon’t know why Paige has us doing all this for Tama—“We have to find\nTama a boyfriend.” Why? I mean, everybody in town needs a boyfriend.\nThe whole world needs a boyfriend. Anyway, so Stephen Sprouse was\ncoming. Poor Stephen, they’re even after him, I think, and he’s scared.\nWorked till 7:45.

We\nleft at 11:55 and we rode over the Brooklyn Bridge and that was the most\nfun part of the night with Paige telling Harold the driver to honk his horn\nlouder and Paige was doing her piercing whistle that comes from her throat\nand as we came over the bridge, the fireworks were going. And then Tama\ncame in the other car and she told us that Steven and Elizabeth Ray had just\nhad a fight, and so later I said to Steven, “So have you had a fight with\nElizabeth yet?” and he said (laughs), “No no, not yet, not yet.”\nAnd then we went to Scott Asen’s house in Turtle Bay and there wasn’t\nmuch happening there. Peter Martins was using the phone in the toilet and\nhis son was just leaving—he’s beautiful, he dances. And Sirio from Le\nCirque was there, and we took him down to Nell’s with us and he was fun.\nNell took her clothes sort of off and threw herself on the table for a\nphotograph and I told Sirio that he had to do that, too, if he wanted to make\nLe Cirque the really “in” place. He said his wife and kids were away so he\nwas just on his own this New Year’s. He invited us for dinner on Sunday.\nPaige and Tama went on to the Tunnel, we dropped them there, and then\ngot home around 4:00, walked the dogs, and it threw my whole day off, it\nwas so stupid to stay out late just because it was New Year’s."

I just don’t answer.\nWent to church, then Paige called and said she’d pick me up for the\nballet (cab $5). The ballets were great. “Symphony in C” which I haven’t\nseen in years, and then two Jerome Robbins ones. We had Peter Martins’s\nseats. Jock and Heather were up there just flying around. And they said I\ncould photograph the company for as long as I want, so I’m going to start\nthat.\nAnne Bass wasn’t at the ballet but she came to the dinner afterwards that\nPaige had arranged at Baton. And Paige and I are fighting. She keeps\nmaking these digs about Jean Michel, she said, “Are you starting up your\ngay affair again with Jean Michel?” and so I got my dig in and said,\n“Listen, I wouldn’t go to bed with him because he’s so dirty, and I can’t\nbelieve that anyone would. I mean, you’re the one who had the affair with a\ndirty, unwashed person.” And then we had a fight about Eizo and shiatsu\nbecause her guy went on vacation so she’s been using Eizo and she asked\nme if he ever did a thing on my stomach and she described how he’d put his\nhands and was shaking it and she got nervous and took his hand away, and\nso I said, “No, but he told me how fat you are”—I was kidding—and so she\nsaid, “Okay, that does it, I’m not using him anymore.” And then I tried to\ntell her he didn’t say she was fat, but she wouldn’t believe me.\nAnd Peter Martins who commissioned me to do the ballet curtain, he\nactually does have great ideas. I didn’t think so before but now I do. He\ntalked to Stephen Sprouse about the Touch Tag thing where the kids who\nplay football use clothes with Velcro so that instead of tackling and wearing\nshoulder pads, they have to tear the Velcro off, so they’re working on the\n“Fluorescent Orange” ballet, and then the kids thought of fluorescent snow.\nAnd when Ulrik told me he hadn’t had time that night to walk his dog, I\nused Heather’s aggressive personality and I said, “Why didn’t you just put\nthe dog on stage and have him do it there and no one would notice.” And I\nwas telling everyone about my idea for a “Shower” ballet that I’ve always\nhad—nude dancers getting into the shower after a heavy dance number and\nthen shaking the water off on the audience.\nThe ballet kids were quiet at first but after ten glasses of wine they were\nreally funny. And Stephen Sprouse was showing how he writes backwards,\nhe’s so clever and he had such beautiful writing. And then something really\nsurreal happened. A busload of eight-year-olds came into this restaurant,\nabout fifty of them, and filled it up, at the bar and everyplace. And we asked\nthem what they were doing there and they said they were going from bar to\nbar researching a school paper. It got really loud and noisy. They said they\nwere going on to Nell’s."

I can see why Carrie Fisher married the Simon guy because\nhe’s like Eddie without curls. If I’d ever met Eddie in the sixties we\nwould’ve been best of friends. Now he just does charity work. The first\nthing he said was, “You did a picture of me.” The one I did in 1962—the\nnewspaper front-page of him and Liz. And I told him about all my crystal\ndoctors and chiropractors and he was really interested and then later as I\nwas leaving the office at 5:00—I had to leave early—he was calling, he’d\nlooked up the Interview number, and so I’ll call him back.

And he\nwas so cute, he’s so sexy, his play Wild Honey just closed on Broadway and\nI really wanted to see it, it looked so good in the TV ads.\nWent to the Dolly Parton party with Sam and Len down to the Gotham\n(cab $3.50). Dolly was arriving right when we got there and she gave a\nspeech saying that this was a party to celebrate signing with CBS Records\nafter being with RCA for twenty years. She just turned forty and she looks\nabsolutely beautiful, but like everything’s been done. She’s really tiny but\nher tits are so huge they have to be implants because you just can’t get that\nthin and still have those big tits— I’m sure they would’ve shrunk. Barry\nDiller came with Calvin and Kelly, and David Brenner came.\nDolly was sweet. Danny Fields was there and I told him I want to tape\nhis life story and he said he would let me.\nAll the Details people were there and they had the new issue with\nStephen Saban’s pictures that he took in a photo booth in ‘65 when we were\ndown at the University of Pennsylvania for my first art show. I guess at the\ntime he was a student and he had me sign one picture and Edie signed\nanother and Gerard signed another. It’s a full page and it looked great.\nAnnie Flanders was there and Michael Musto. James St. James was wearing\nfour-inch heels and so was Dolly. And a black guy named Childs was there\nand he said, “I’m Cedar Bar,” meaning he was somebody who used to hang\naround there, and he looked at young Sam sitting there with his snotty\nattitude and said, “I see these young kids and all I can think is, ‘Pay your\ndues.’ “ And he was right, Sam has a lot to learn and I hope he learns it. I\nspoiled him, taking him to glamorous places when his mind wasn’t ready\nfor it. Now he thinks that’s what he deserves and he’s fresh to everybody.\nAnd then Paige and I walked over to Nell’s. It was beautiful weather, in\nthe forties or fifties. And Nell’s was so glamorous. Fred was there with Ian\nMcKellen and his I guess boyfriend Sean. And against the wall was Claus\nvon Bulow and Cosima and Andrea Reynolds, and Nell just goes around\ntaking pictures of people like Fred passed out on the divans. She has a\nfunny picture of Taki whispering in Bob Colacello’s ear and Anthony\nHaden-Guest trying to hear it. And Sting was there, he wears Cerutti clothes\nnow, and Nell asked him how his career and all started and he said this and\nthat happened and then he said, “And then Andy made me a star.” Maybe\nwe were the first to put him alone on a magazine cover. He said he wants to\ndo plays now. I don’t know why Sting would ever do that Frankenstein\nmovie, The Bride. If it had been a singing Frankenstein, that would’ve been\nsomething.\nAnd then Nell left her chair and then Bob Dylan came over and sat\ndown and he said he’d just seen my photography show at the Miller Gallery\n—that he’d literally just come from there. And then Nell came back and\npretended she didn’t know who he was and said that that was her seat.\nI want Nell to take pictures for Interview, but she only takes color\npictures so I left her some of my black and white film.\nI introduced von Bulow to Nell and then to Dylan. I lost my scarf and I\nwas glad because I hated it. But then I found it. That cashmere scarf I\nordered from Brigid’s friend who knitted it on a machine and it was\nsupposed to be like the red Halston one I’d lost, but the Halston one was\nsomehow so light and this one is so heavy. Paige dropped me off at 2:00.\nAnd poor Bess Myerson’s on suspension. She’s really in trouble because\nthey say she sort of bribed a judge to reduce her married boyfriend’s\nalimony payments. I can’t believe all these men fighting over this sixty-\nyear-old lady."

Why didn’t they shoot over\ntheir heads? Or use tear gas. It makes you think that Communists did it to\nother Communists just to start trouble.

If Paige wants to meet\nmen and get married she should be going to football games, not to the\nballet! Go bowling in Brooklyn—Manhattan is too sophisticated.\nThen there were tickets put aside for me at the Joyce Theater where\nRobert LaFosse was doing a guest appearance in Karole Armitage’s ballet.\nThis is the thing that her boyfriend David Salle did the costumes for, he’s\nthe artistic director. And then Paige had arranged dinner at Indochine with\nthe New York City Ballet people to talk about the curtain they want me to\ndesign.

But they say there are too many killings there and\nthat they could just take the land away from you at any time. But gee, it’s so\ncheap.\nStuart and I went to Sotheby’s and it was packed, they had Americana.\nJamie Wyeth was there but not Phyllis, and he looks older, he’s lost his\nboyish charm, he’s grander. Then I felt worse so I went to the drugstore and\ngot some Maalox.\nAnd Peter Wise called up, I knew he would call because I heard he\nwants a job with Stuart Pivar. But ever since that time he wouldn’t accept\nmy word over Kent Klineman’s, I just think he’s stupid….Didn’t I ever tell\nthe Diary about this? About the big fight I had with Peter? I mean, here I’d\nbeen good friends with him for six years and I’m telling him a fact and\nsuddenly he was saying, “Well that’s not what Kent says,” and I said, “Well\nif 1 say something’s red and you can see that it’s not, you should still\nbelieve me because we’re friends.” So I told him that if he didn’t want to\nbelieve me he should just ask Fred and he did and it turned out I was right,\nbut he hadn’t believed me alone, and that made me so mad, I just thought it\nwas so awful. And when he called yesterday we never got around to talking\nabout the job he wants to get working for Stuart, but I know that’s what he\nwanted.\nAnd now somehow I’ve hired Chris’s friend Ken to pick me up in the\nmornings, he’s going to be my new bodyguard. He’s a really good-looking\ntall blond kid. The one from Florida.\nSo then I went over to the Joyce Theater and Tama met us there, she\ncame in from Princeton (tickets $40). The production was stinkeroo, but\nRobert LaFosse is really professional.\nThen after the ballet I couldn’t face dinner at Indochine so I just went to\na fruit stand and I got a pineapple and bananas and apples and I went home.\nThe driver asked me for an autograph so I had to tip big (cab $9). And then\nI made juices out of the stuff and by the time I was done it had taken so\nlong I could’ve gone to the dinner—after squeezing everything and washing\nout the juicer.

Heather Watts wanted to meet the poorest kid in New York\nbecause she’s been spending so much time with Anne Bass, so Stephen\nSprouse brought her a cute messenger who has a twelve-inch tattoo. They\nput two tables together for us in the front, and there was a Mafia-type guy at\nthe bar who said stuff about Stephen’s punk hair, and Stephen got so scared\nhe left and then Paige went over and started telling the guy off, and she\nalmost got it, she really almost was history. He was a greaseball, a big ox,\nabout 6’5”. Huge. So then Peter Martins was obligated to go over and\ndefend Paige and then Jock Soto got up, too, and all I could think of was\nthat the whole New York City Ballet company would be wiped out by this\nMafia bruiser at the bar. It was scary. A lot of talk like “asshole” and all\nthose words. Heather loved it.\nSo Peter was a man and defended Paige but after the bruiser left, he was\nso relieved that he sank in his chair and he told her, “Paige, I’m never going\nout with you again—you’re too much troubled\nDropped Wilfredo off and went home to bed (cab $6.50)."

He looked so healthy when he came to the office\nlast year, didn’t he?\nI called Nell to ask her to be that week’s emcee for our TV show but she\nsaid she was on the other line talking to Australia and she’d call me right\nback but she never did, which I thought was weird.\nA couple of people have called and said they were doing biographies of\nme. Fred told them we didn’t want them to, but they said they’ll do them\nanyway.\nWorked and then they picked me up for the black-tie dinner at the Saint\nthat Rado Watches was giving and it was all built around the painting I did\nand Sarah Vaughn singing. And we were all afraid to eat anything because\nthe Saint has the gay taint from when it used to be a gay disco. It was so\ndark there and they were serving the food on black plates.\nBut Sarah Vaughn sang and she was great—fat and sweating but she’s\nstill got a voice. And then they wanted us to go to her room and so they\ntook us there and it was past all the bad rooms where all the sex things used\nto happen. We were holding our breath. And we told Sarah she was great,\nbut she was just interested in her drink, she told somebody, “Cap my\nbrandy,” or something like that. She’ll be at the Blue Note in April.\nThen we were hungry so Paige and Wilfredo and I went next door to that\nplace called “103” on Second Avenue and that’s where we should take\npeople to dinner because it came to $11 for three teas, a Coke, a bowl of\nchili, and two sandwiches. Could that have been a mistake? Left a big tip\n($20). And we picked up a couple of waiters for Wilfredo to use as models\nin the shoots he’s setting up in Atlantic City for Interview."

I think she’s like Ann Magnuson, that’s why she just hasn’t\nmade it. I mean, in show business.

I guess it was a gallbladder\nattack. And then I remembered that when I got the first one was when Fred\ntook me to the Waldorf to meet the old Mrs. Woodward who was about\nninety then—it was ‘73 or ‘74 I think—and he had to take me to the\nhospital, and then this week is when that novel Nick Dunne wrote, The Two\nMrs. Grenvilles, is on TV, which was really the Elsie Woodward story, so I\nfelt like there was a connection."

On Sunday, Andy stayed in bed all day and the\npain subsided. On Monday he kept his appointment with Dr. Linda M. Li at\nthe Li Chiropractic Healing Arts Center. That night Dr. Burke called Andy\nto see how he was and when he admitted that he was again feeling the\nsharp pains, she urged him to see his regular doctor, Dr. Denton Cox.\nAlthough on Tuesday he made his “celebrity appearance” in the Japanese\nfashion show, he was in pain for the rest of the night. Finally at 6:30 A.M.\nhe took a painkiller and sleeping pill which made him sleep through the\nWednesday 9 A.M. Diary phone call. On Thursday, when Andy answered the\nphone at 9 A.M. he was breathing heavily. He told me hehad seen Dr. Cox\nand that he was going to “the place” to have “it” done (Andy’s fear of\nhospitals and operations was so great that he couldn’t bring himself to say\nthose specific words) because “they told me I’ll die if I don’t.” He said he\nwould resume doing the Diary after “it” was over, that he would call me\nfrom “the place.”\nOn Friday, February 20, Andy was admitted to New York Hospital as an\n“ambulatory emergency patient.” On Saturday his gallbladder was\nremoved, and he appeared to be recovering well from the surgery—he\nwatched television, and made phone calls to friends. But early Sunday\nmorning, for reasons that are in litigation, he died.\nA few weeks later, the woman who had admitted him to the hospital told\nme that Andy was the only person in her experience who had ever\nremembered his Blue Cross and health insurance identification-card\nnumbers by heart.]"
